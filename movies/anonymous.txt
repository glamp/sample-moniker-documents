1   BLACK SCREEN                                                   1

TITLES BEGIN over the SOUNDS of city traffic.
 
                                                    FADE UP:

 
2   EXT. THEATER DISTRICT OF BROADWAY - DUSK                       2

The sidewalks are filled with theater-goers heading for
their shows. Cabs line the streets.
 
    SIDE ALLEY

A cab quickly turns into the alley, coming to a
screeching halt. A Man in a Grey Suit jumps out and
rushes to the side entrance of a theater.
 
In the background we see that the title of the play,
"Anonymous", is written on the theatre's marquee...
 
 
3   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DUSK                       3

We follow the Man in the Grey Suit as he rushes through
narrow backstage hallways, passing several ACTORS
dressing in Elizabethan costumes, applying their make-
up, etc...
 
    TITLES CONTINUE.

 
4   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE/EMPTY STAGE - DUSK           4

The curtains are still closed, and the sound of the
audience excitedly MURMURING behind them is heard. .
 
Stagehands are moving stage lights as--
 
    A STAGE MANAGER

takes a nervous peek through the curtains to check the
audience-- it's a full house. He holds a prop umbrella
in one hand, anxiously checks his watch in the other.
 
He looks on both wings of the stage-- and then relief
floods his face as he sees The Man in the Grey Suit
hurrying over to him. The Stage Manager wordlessly
hands him the umbrella and signals to a stagehand in
the background.
 
The curtains start to OPEN and the MURMUR of the
audience dies down.
 
 
                                                               1

5   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS                5

The man with the umbrella stands on the empty stage, a
single light on him. He is "PROLOGUE". (We will see
the same actor later as the "Prologue" of Henry V).
 
"Prologue" regards his audience for a   beat before:
 
                              PROLOGUE
                Soul of the Age!
The applause, delight, the wonder of
our stage!
Our Shakespeare, rise...
(beat, repeating)
Our Shakespeare... For he is all of
ours, is he not? The most performed
playwright of all time! The author of
37 plays, 154 sonnets, and several
epic poems that are collectively known
as the ultimate expressions of
humanity in the English language. And
yet... And yet...
(beat)
Not a single manuscript of any kind
has ever been found written in
Shakespeare's own hand. In four
hundred years, not one document-- be
it poem, play, diary or even a simple
letter.
(beat)
He was born the son of a glove-maker,
and at some unknown time, armed with
but an elementary school education, he
went to London where, the story goes,
he became an actor and eventually a
playwright.
 
    OFF STAGE

A stagehand takes a wooden hammer and beats against a
flat metal pate, creating the SOUNDS of THUNDER.
 
Another stagehand starts to lift shutters in front of a
stage light back and forth to create LIGHTNING STRIKES.
 
    ON STAGE

"Prologue" opens his umbrella.
 
                             PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
                He died at the age of 56, and was
survived by his wife and two daughters
who were, like Shakespeare's own
father, irrefutably illiterate.
 
                                                              2
                                                 pg. 3
 
 
OFF STAGE

In the rafters a stagehand opens valves.   It starts to
RAIN.

                         PROLOGUE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
            His will famously left his second best
bed to his widow. But it made no
mention of a single book or
manuscript.
 
The actor who will play "Ben JONSON" (mid 30's) appears
in the wings, bearded, ready to go on stage, holding a
prop leather manuscript. Behind him a group of
Elizabethan "soldiers" strap on their swords.
 
ON STAGE

"Prologue" continues, as do TITLES.
 
                         PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
            Is it possible Shakespeare owned no
books at his death because... he could
not read? That he wrote no letters
because he, like his father before him
and his children after him, could not
write?
(lets that sink in, then)
Our Shakespeare is a cypher, a ghost;
his biography made not by history...
but by conjecture. His story not
written with facts, but with...
imagination.
 
The rain has intensified. "Prologue" turns and the
camera starts to leave him and the TITLES END....
 
                         PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
                   (more energetic)
So! Let me offer you a different
story. A darker story... Of quills
and swords. Of power and betrayal.
Of a stage conquered, and a throne
lost!
 
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING, and for a moment only sheets of
RAIN are visible. No stage, no "Prologue". Then,
trough the rain, we see a form of a man... Ben
Jonson... running. Then we make out the shapes of
houses... a street. We're not on a stage anymore. We
are:
 
 
 
 
                                                          3
                                                      pg. 4
 
 
6    EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - 1604 NIGHT                             6

Jonson-- carrying the manuscript-- runs up the street
toward a large circular theater.
 
He frantically opens the wooden door to the theater--
 
 
7    INT. THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT                                 7

--and he quickly bolts it behind him, turns, and
desperately looks for a place to hide. He runs towards
the stage as--
 
 
8    EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            8

About a dozen uniformed guards reach the door. They
are led by Sir Richard POLE (40), Captain of the Guard.
 
                            POLE
               Break it down!
 
And several of the guards charge the door with their
pikes, HITTING it hard.
 
                            POLE (CONT'D)
               Again!
 
 
9    INT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            9

Jonson hurries backstage, and disappears from our view
just as--
 
 
10   EXT/INT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                    10

--the guards SMASH the door open.    Pole is the first
in.
 
                             POLE
               Jonson!   Jonson!!    Show yourself!
 
The soldiers immediately spread out into different
parts of the theater. Jonson's gone. Because--
 
     JONSON

has moved under the stage silently scurrying like a rat
trying to find a place to hide among the stacks of
props and costumes (swords, masks, flags and banners,
shields, barrels, canons, etc.) But Jonson freezes
when he sees--
 
                                                               4
                                                pg. 5
 
 
THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE STAGE'S FLOORBOARDS

--the soldiers jump onto the stage and spread out, Pole
amongst them.
 
                          POLE (CONT'D)
            Out with you! Jonson! We'll smoke
you out like a rat if we have to!
(beat)
Jonson?! Jonson!!
 
Nothing.    A beat, then--
 
                         POLE (CONT'D)
                   (to a soldier)
Torch it.
 
The soldier hesitates.
 
                          POLE (CONT'D)
            Torch it!   All of you!
 
The soldiers obey, lighting fire to the walls, the
galleries, the columns as--
 
JONSON

GASPS in horror. Desperate-- he spies an open metal
box nearby filled with un-used fireworks.
 
He tosses the fireworks out of the box-- and then
places the bound manuscripts in their place, then
closes the box. Then-- he grabs a nearby rapier as--
 
FLAMES

--begin to take hold everywhere: the columns at the
front of the stage... the trompe-l'oeil walls... the
seating galleries... the columns...
 
A TRAP DOOR

opens center-stage, and Jonson JUMPS out, the rapier in
his right hand, ready for a fight. But-- three
soldiers jump onto the stage, pikes ready.
 
Jonson-- no fool- turns and runs for the other end of
the stage-- but then runs smack into four other
soldiers!
 
Ballocks!
 
Jonson turns this way and that-- nowhere to run-- grins
wryly, drops his sword. Raises his hands in surrender.
 
                                                          5
                                                      pg. 6
 
 
11   EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT                            11

Jonson, his hands tied behind him, is pushed through
the door, Pole following.
 
A small crowd of actors, whores, etc., watch the
theater burn. The guards have to push their way
through them.
 
     INSERT

The fire reaches the fireworks below the theater's
stage, and--
 
     BACK TO SCENE

-- the SOUND of fireworks EXPLODING makes Jonson turn
and see:
 
     THE THEATER

Timbers CRASH and fireworks EXPLODE over the theater.
 
 
12   EXT. THE THAMES RIVER - DAWN                             12

A longboat carrying Jonson, Pole and the guards makes
its way towards the Tower Of London.
 
 
13   INT. TOWER OF LONDON - AN INTERROGATION ROOM - DAWN      13

Jonson is thrown into a chair, a guard on either side
of him. It's dark-- the only light coming from a few
torches in the walls, and a large fire pit at the far
side of the room.
 
An INTERROGATOR (30's) faces him.   Dressed all in
black, he is wispy thin.
 
                            INTERROGATOR
               You are Benjamin Jonson, playwright?
Son of William Jonson, glass-blower,
son of James Jonson brick-layer?
 
Jonson nods.
 
                            INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
               And have you ever been arrested
before, Mr. Jonson?
 
                            JONSON
               I'm a writer, aren't I?   Of course
I've bloody well been--
 
                                                              6
                                                     pg. 7
 
 
And a guard BACKHANDS Jonson on the face full force--
hard enough to send Jonson and the chair to the ground.
His nose starts to bleed.
 
As the Guards pull him up, the Interrogator looks
across the room-- there is someone else there, a
FIGURE, watching, but cloaked in the darkness.
 
Jonson notices the figure as well.      We hear a voice
from the darkness.
 
                          FIGURE
             Ask him about the plays.
 
                            JONSON
                      (to the Interrogator)
Plays?
(to the Figure)
Which would you prefer, my lord? A
pastoral? An historical? An
historical-pastoral, or an hysterical
historical pastoral--
 
And SMACK!    He's hit by the guards again.   He SPITS out
a tooth.
 
                          INTERROGATOR
             We are not interested in your plays,
Jonson. We are interested in the
plays given to you by Edward de Vere,
Earl of Oxford.
 
Jonson stares at him a beat, and then looks into the
darkness.
 
                          JONSON
             I'm sorry my lord, but I am not sure I
know whereof you speak. I have had
the honor of meeting his lordship--
 
And SMACK--
 
                                              FLASH CUT TO:

FACES

laughing. Not in this room, somewhere else. Somewhere
outside. Before we really understand what we are
seeing we are:
 
BACK IN THE CELL

Jonson blinks, trying to stay conscious.      His mouth is
ripped, bleeding. So is his nose.
 
                                                              7
                                                       pg. 8
 
 
The skin has broken on his forehead.     The Interrogator
leans into the bloody Jonson.
 
                               INTERROGATOR
                  Where are the plays?
 
Before Jonson even has a chance to answer-- SMACK!
 
                                                        CUT TO:

     MORE FACES

Laughing.    We are:
 
 
14   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                  14

And it is nine years earlier. The faces come from an
audience watching a play. They find the performance
hysterical.
 
 
15   EXT. ROSE THEATER/BANKSIDE LONDON - CONTINUOUS               15

The Rose towers above the nearby buildings "Bankside"
(the part of London that houses the theaters,
whorehouses, etc.).

                              SOUTHAMPTON (O.S.)
                  Well?
 
     TWO MEN

walk towards the theater. Edward de Vere (47), the
Earl of OXFORD, an intensely handsome man. His clothes
have seen better days.
 
His companion is Henry Wriothesley, Earl of SOUTHAMPTON
(22). Blonde, attractive, a bit of a pretty boy-- and
extremely enthusiastic.
 
                               SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                  Wonderful, isn't it?
 
                               OXFORD
                         (frowning slightly)
Well, it's certainly... big.
 
 
 
 
                                                                  8
                                                  pg. 9
 
 
                       SOUTHAMPTON
          I promise you, Edward, you've seen
nothing like it before! Nothing!
 
                       OXFORD
          Bricklayers and whores watching
Aristophones?   You're quite right,
Henry, not only have I never witnessed
it, I'm not sure I care to.
 
                       SOUTHAMPTON
                 (teasing)
You're an elitist, you know that,
Edward?
 
Oxford pauses at the entrance.
 
                       OXFORD
          There won't be puppets, will there?
 
Southampton grins and gives a few coins to an USHER,
who escorts the two of them (the retainers stay
outside) inside.
 
                        USHER
          My lords...
 
 
INT. THE ENTRY OF THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

The usher takes them up a flight of stairs.    Oxford
observes everything as they walk.
 
                       SOUTHAMPTON
          The stage-craft is quite spectacular.
Far more elaborate than anything I've
seen at court. I've witnessed be-
headings that god as my witness look
as real as at the Tower, cannons fired
in battle...
 
They come to the second floor, where a SELLING-MAID has
a box of food and drink in front of her bosom-- much
like a match-stick girl.
 
                        SELLING-MAID
          Ale?   Mutton, mi' lord?
 
Southampton waves her off as they follow the usher up
another flight of stairs.
 
 
 
 
                                                          9
                                                   pg. 10
 
 
                        SOUTHAMPTON
           ...and last week, they had some sort
of a device to hoist cherubs into the
air and fly over the entire audience!
 
                        OXFORD
           An ap mekhanes thes. Deus ex
machina. Machine of the Gods.
 
And as they ascend up more stairs, Oxford catches
glimpses of the stage and performance through the
rafters and over the heads of the attending audience.
 
                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
           Whenever the Greeks wrote their heroes
into a situation from which they
couldn't write their way out--
 
Oxford is becoming intrigued by the theater, almost
despite himself.
 
                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
           --Out came the ap mekhanes thes...
As when Hippolytus is saved by
Artemis, or Medea flown to Athens...
Always good for an ap mekhanes thes
was Euripides
 
Oxford continues up, two steps behind Southampton.
 
They come to the third floor and enter the box seating
area reserved for nobles, giving Oxford his first real
look at the theater itself. Oxford looks around and
sees-
 
FROM OXFORD'S POV

Audience members LAUGHING-- others DRINKING-- maids
SELLING food-- the actors ACTING...
 
It's alive.   Magical.
 
BACK TO OXFORD

Oxford takes it all in, almost stunned by it.
 
ON-STAGE

The actor William SHAKESPEARE (30) plays a commoner.
He is handsome, sexy, charismatic; and holds a tankard
of ale, and SWIGS from it constantly.
 
Another actor SPENCER (30) plays "FASTIDIOUS"; a
pompous, over-dressed, caricature of a nobleman.
 
                                                            10
                                                    pg. 11
 
 
He wears an enormous feather on his hat. Also on stage
is an actor called John HEMINGE (late 40's), who plays
"Sogliardo"
 
                         SHAKESPEARE
            And whither were you riding now,
signior?
 
                         "FASTIDIOUS"
            Who, I? What a silly jest's that!
Whither should I ride but to the
court?
 
                         SHAKESPEARE
            O, pardon me, sir, twenty places more;
your hot-house, your pig-house, or
your whore-house!
 
The audience ROARS in laughter as Shakespeare looks
below at a buxom young lady among the "groundlings".
He smiles seductively. She smiles back.
 
BACKSTAGE

Jonson (now 25 and clean-shaven) is watching the
performance from behind a curtain, silently speaking
the lines with the actors.
 
IN THE RAISED SEATING

A group of playwrights and poets watch the play with an
air of judgement. They are: Christopher "Kit" MARLOWE
(32), young, brilliant, a bit foppish (he likes the
boys), Thomas NASHE (late 30's)-- a heavy-set, a hard
drinking satirist-- and Thomas DEKKER (29), considered
a bit of a hack by his colleagues.
 
They are called the "Mermaid's Wits" because they
frequent a pub named The Mermaid's Tavern.
 
                         NASHE
                   (takes a swig of ale)
His second play, and almost a full
house.
(burps)
He's got a wit, does Jonson.
 
                         MARLOWE
            That might be so, but like a grain of
wheat hid in a bushel of chaff: you
shall seek all day ere you find it,
and when you have it, it's not worth
the search!

The others smile as a WOMAN passes.
 
                         WOMAN
          Ale!   Ale!!
 
                       DEKKER
          Marlowe-- spot me a few pence, will
you? Henslowe still owes me for
"Shoemaker's Holiday".
 
                       MARLOWE
                 (retrieving coins)
That would be because no one saw
"Shoemaker's Holiday".
 
                         DEKKER
          Ale here!
 
Marlowe gives the woman a few pennies as--
 
                       NASHE
          Kit... Isn't that one of your
unrequited loves in the box over
there?
 
Marlowe glances across the theater and spots
Southampton siting next to Oxford.
 
                       MARLOWE
                 (frowns)
But with whom? Tell me not he prefers
the company of such old grey men as
that!
 
Nashe squints.
 
                       NASHE
          I think-- yes, by the beard, that's
the Earl of Oxford. Old Tom Hooker
used to play for him. Had his own
acting troupe for private Court
performances and the like.
 
                       DEKKER
          I wonder if he needs any material?
 
                       MARLOWE
          Certainly not any of yours.
 
                       NASHE
          No, no-- that was years ago. Had a
falling out with the Queen, I heard.
He's more of a recluse than a patron
these days.

ON STAGE

Shakespeare points to "Fastidious".
 
                          SHAKESPEARE
             Who, he, the noble there? Why, he's a
gull, a fool, no salt in him i' the
earth; man, he looks like a fresh
salmon kept in a tub!
 
Shakespeare struts around as though he owned the place.
The more he talks, the more the audience ROARS in
laughter.
 
                          SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
             He sleeps with a musk-cat every night,
and walks all day hang'd in perfumed
chains for penance.
 
                           A GROUNDLING
             Oi!   So that's what I been smelling!
 
More groundlings laugh.     Interestingly--
 
NOBLEMEN

in the box seats do not.
 
ON STAGE

Shakespeare continues his rant, speaking directly to
the groundlings.
 
                          SHAKESPEARE
             He has his skin tann'd in civet, to
make his complexion strong, and the
sweetness of his youth lasting in the
sense of his sweet lady. And, sadly,
the poor man's brain is lighter than
his feather...
 
As the audience HOWLS in laughter, we see:
 
A NOBLEMAN

with a feathered hat gets up in fury, and exits the
theater, his lady with him. The Audience LAUGHS at him
as he goes.
 
ON STAGE

Shakespeare smiles triumphantly.
 
 
 
                                                              13
                                                   pg. 14
 
 
                         SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
            He is a good and empty puff, but he
loves you well, signior. I wish you
well with him.
 
OXFORD

Watches the nobleman with the big feathered hat pass
by.
 
BACKSTAGE

Later in the play...
 
Shakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig
from his tankard. He's actually drunk, though his
performance didn't show it at all. He spots Jonson,
and grabs him.
 
                        SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
            Jonson! Wonderful dialogue!
Wonderful. I hope your next--
 
                          HENSLOWE (O.C.)
            Will!   Will Shakespeare!
 
Shakespeare turns to see a furious Philip HENSLOWE
(50'S) heading his way.
 
                         HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
            That's not ale in that goblet is it?
 
Shakespeare hides the goblet behind his back.
 
                         SHAKESPEARE
            Ale? Me? Drink during a performance?
I am a professional sir!
(burps)
A complete and--
 
He is interrupted by SCREAMS.    Not from actors on
stage, but by the audience.
 
IN THE THEATER

Complete panic erupts as dozens of The Queen's Guard
STORM into the theater. Everyone tries to get out as
quickly as possible, including the other actors, Henry
CONDELL (20's), Thomas POPE (30's), William SLY (13).
 
SIR RICHARD POLE, THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD

--jumps on stage.
 
 
                                                            14
                                                    pg. 15
 
 
                        POLE
           This play has been declared seditious
and illegal by Lord William Cecil!
 
The audience begins to BOO at the mention of Cecil.
 
                        POLE (CONT'D)
           All are herewith ordered to disperse
immediately!
 
                        A GROUNDLING
           Why don't you disperse William Cecil's
arse!
 
                        POLE
           Arrest that man!
 
IN OXFORD'S BOX

                          SOUTHAMPTON
           Damn it all.    Well! Off to Essex's
then?
 
He gets up. Oxford does not, seemingly interested in
the real drama below as everyone hurries from the
theater.
 
                          SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
           Edward?
 
Oxford turns to him, distracted, and nods.
 
ON STAGE

Jonson pushes his way on stage.
 
                        JONSON
                  (to Pole)
Seditious? Seditious?! It's a comedy
for god's sake! There's nothing
seditious about--
 
                        POLE
           Oi, is that right, is it?    And you
know this because?
 
                        JONSON
           Because I wrote the bloody thing!      And-
           -

                        POLE
           Arrest him as well!
 
Jonson is grabbed by guards.
 
                                                             15
                                                       pg. 16
 
 
17   INT. A JAIL CELL - DAY                                        17

Jonson is THROWN into the cell, the door SLAMMED behind
him.
 
                             JONSON
                      (to the door)
A pox on you!
(beat)
And your carbuncled father!
 
Jonson looks around-- the cell is filled with a dozen
or so other prisoners.
 
                            ESSEX (O.S.)
               People taxed to the point of
starvation, Spain running the New
World, open revolt in Ireland,
Catholic plots everywhere you turn...
 
                                                        CUT TO:

 
18   INT. TENNIS COURT AT ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                        18

Robert, Earl of ESSEX (28), is playing tennis against
Southampton. He's handsome, red-headed, and, we will
learn, very ambitious.
 
                            ESSEX
               ...and how do the Cecils spend their
time and energy? Shutting a theater!
A theater, for god's sake? It's
madness! No wonder the mob hates them
so!
 
The court is inside, and slightly different from
today's game: the back walls are playable, somewhat
like racquet-ball.
 
Oxford sits on a bench, watching.   Essex SLAMS a shot,
but it goes--
 
                              OXFORD
               Out!
 
Essex looks furious, but holds his tongue.   Southampton
prepares to serve.
 
                            OXFORD (CONT'D)
                      (to Southampton)
Henry, how many people were at that
play?
 
 
                                                                  16
                                                     pg. 17
 
 
Southampton pauses before serving.
 
                           SOUTHAMPTON
               Hmm? I'm not sure, two thousand,
maybe more.
 
Southampton SERVES.   Essex returns, and another heated
rally begins.
 
                            OXFORD
               And how many performances are there of
a play like that?
 
                            SOUTHAMPTON
               Five or six I suppose.
 
He HITS the ball again, and this time Essex misses it.
 
                             ESSEX
               By the--!
 
                            OXFORD
                      (to Essex)
So! Ten thousand souls. All
listening to the writings of one man--
the ideas of one man. That's power,
Robert. And if there is one thing the
Cecils understand, it's power.
 
                            ESSEX
                      (snorts)
And when did words ever win a kingdom?
I think I'll keep my sword, thank you
very much.
 
Southampton SERVES as Oxford smiles at Essex's naivet.
 
 
19   INT. CHANGING ROOMS/ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                      19

Southampton and Essex are dressing out of their tennis
clothes and into their normal clothes, assisted by two
valets.
 
                            ESSEX
                      (to the valets)
Leave us.
(they exit)
Henry... Some of my men have...
intercepted... some of William Cecil's
recent correspondence with King James
of Scotland...
 
 
 
                                                               17
                                                 pg. 18
 
 
Southampton pauses in clothing himself.   This is
serious.
 
                       ESSEX (CONT'D)
          Cecil's all but promising him the
throne...
 
                        SOUTHAMPTON
          To James?   Elizabeth would never agree
to-
 
                       ESSEX
          Elizabeth is old. Ill. Not of her
old mind. Sometimes she doesn't even
recognize me. And yet, still she
refuses to name an heir.
 
                       SOUTHAMPTON
          But a Scotsman? On the Tudor throne?
 
                       ESSEX
          You are not in the Privy Council.
Elizabeth does everything the Cecils
wish of her. Everything!
 
BEHIND THEM

Oxford enters. They don't notice, though. He
instantly realizes he shouldn't say anything. He
listens as:
 
WIDER

                        ESSEX (CONT'D)
          Think, Henry, if James owes Cecil his
throne, Cecil will have more influence
in the next reign than he does in this
one. And after William Cecil, his
hunch-backed son will take his
place...
(careful)
That is why we must do everything in
our power to ensure that the right man
succeeds her.
(beat)
A man deserving of the Tudor crown.
 
Southampton stiffens at that last phrase.
 
                       ESSEX (CONT'D)
          I ask you for the support of you and
your men, Henry.... if it comes to a
fight.
 
 
                                                          18
                                                       pg. 19
 
 
Southampton looks at Essex hard.
 
                             SOUTHAMPTON
                You know you need not ask. I stand
with you, as I always have.
 
Essex smiles at him warmly. They both HEAR something
shuffle behind them. They turn, and see:
 
     WHERE OXFORD WAS STANDING

Nothing.   He is gone.
 
     BACK TO SOUTHAMPTON AND ESSEX

They exchange a slightly worried look.
 
                                                         CUT TO:

 
20   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                         20

Moments later, Oxford and Southampton are exiting the
elaborate building that serves as Essex's London
residence.
 
                             OXFORD
                Essex played rather poorly, didn't he?
 
Southampton just nods, distracted.   Oxford reaches out
to him, and touches his shoulder.
 
                             OXFORD (CONT'D)
                       (warning)
Henry... The Cecils brook no rivals.
 
Southampton pauses, confused for an instant, then--
 
                             SOUTHAMPTON
                       (re: his discussion with
Essex)
You heard?
 
Oxford nods.
 
                             SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                Always concerned for me, aren't you
Edward?
 
They keep walking towards Southampton's men.
 
                             SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                And what would you have me do?
 
 
                                                                   19
                                                  pg. 20
 
 
                       OXFORD
          I would have you deny him.
 
                       SOUTHAMPTON
          The son of the Queen?
 
                       OXFORD
          That is rumor only, Henry--
 
They stop. Southampton makes sure that his men are out
of earshot.
 
                       SOUTHAMPTON
          Rumor? My god, all you have to do is
look at Essex to see the Queen's
reflection. Everyone thinks he's her
son, everyone! And I for one would
rather bow to a Tudor, bastard though
he may be, than a Scotsman!
 
                        OXFORD
          I desire nothing more than to see the
next king be the rightful king. But
what Essex contemplates will surely
lead to Civil War.
(beat)
No. If this is to be done, it must be
done carefully, skillfully.
 
                       SOUTHAMPTON
          As I heard it, Elizabeth exiled you
from her presence for the last twenty
years because of your "skill" at Court
politics.
 
And then he feels instantly ashamed of having said
that.
 
                       OXFORD
          I only have your interests in mind,
Henry. For as you so rightly point
out, my interests are already lost.
 
                       SOUTHAMPTON
          I know. Forgive me. You know how I
feel about you. You have been a great
friend to me ever since my father
died. I promise you that I will do
nothing rash without consulting you
first.
 
Oxford nods, still worried, and Southampton heads for
his horse.
 
 
                                                           20
                                                      pg. 21
 
 
                            OXFORD
               Henry! Will you do me one thing more?
Deliver a gift for me? A rather...
elaborate gift?
 
 
21   EXT. CECIL HOUSE - SUNSET                                  21

The stone house is nothing like a stereotypical Tudor
house; it's enormous, and very ornate and intricate in
design.
 
It faces the river, and has an elaborate docking area
which is now filled with all sorts of longboats letting
the noblemen off for a week-end get away.
 
 
22   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DUSK                       22

Most of England's nobility is assembled in small
groups, talking. It's a dour, quiet affair. Some
music, no life. Quite Puritan.
 
Southampton is there, but Essex and Oxford are nowhere
to be seen.
 
     A HUNCH-BACKED MAN

--makes his way through the room, causing conversations
to cease as he walks by. Even the most senior of the
nobles bow their heads slightly in greeting him. This
is Sir ROBERT CECIL (mid 30's).
 
He pauses near Southampton.
 
                              SOUTHAMPTON
               Sir Robert.
 
                            ROBERT CECIL
               My lord of Southampton.
(looking around)
Have you seen Essex?
 
                            SOUTHAMPTON
               I believe he is still in the viewing
chamber with her majesty...
 
                              ROBERT CECIL
                        (sharp, annoyed)
Alone?
 
 
 
 
                                                               21
                                                  pg. 22
 
 
                       SOUTHAMPTON
                 (smiles)
With your father in London dealing
with all the troubles in Ireland, who
else should the Queen turn to but
Essex?
 
Robert Cecil looks annoyed, but holds his tongue as the
SOUND of pikes HITTING the floor silences the hall.
 
A FOOTMAN clears his throat and--
 
                       FOOTMAN
          By the grace of god, her majesty,
Elizabeth, Queen of England, Wales and
Ireland!
 
DOUBLE DOORS

open, and Elizabeth (in her 60's) enters. She is
wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a
wide collar.
 
She walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor
in her head and hands. She seems un-certain; like
she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her
(Alzheimer's?). And she compensates for it by being
all the more regal, all the more un-human.
 
Essex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel-
encrusted doublet.
 
Robert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm.
 
Essex ignores Cecil's glare, notices Southampton--
 
                       ESSEX
                 (to Elizabeth)
Ah-- Majesty, I've been told my lord
of Southampton has a gift for you.
 
                       ELIZABETH
                 (eyes sparkle)
A gift?
 
                       SOUTHAMPTON
          Yes, your grace, though not from me.
 
Southampton CLAPS his hands and a door across the room
OPENS.

A DWARF enters, followed by dancing faires, actors
swirling sparklers, and musicians playing music.
 
 
                                                           22
                                                  pg. 23
 
 
Elizabeth's rheumy eyes widen in complete delight, a
smile of total jubilation crosses her face.
 
Robert Cecil, on the other hand, looks horrified.
 
                       ELIZABETH
          Are you this gift, my precious little
man?
 
                       DWARF
          No, no, my most majestic majesty. I
am a free man. My gift is a play,
majesty.
 
                       ELIZABETH
          A play?
 
The dwarf bows his assent.
 
                       ROBERT CECIL
                 (to the Dwarf)
Plays are the work of the devil, born
from a cesspool of plague, whoredom,
thievery, fornication, and heresy.
You may tell your master that her
majesty--
 
                       ESSEX
                 (interrupting)
--Will gladly accept your gift.
 
Robert Cecil turns to Essex, shocked.
 
                       ESSEX (CONT'D)
                 (to Elizabeth)
Of course that is if you so desire,
majesty.
(to Robert Cecil)
The choice is her majesty's to make,
not yours. Is that not so Sir Robert?
 
Robert frowns as Elizabeth looks around, unsure of the
political tides around her. Then--
 
                       ELIZABETH
                 (to the dwarf)
Comedy? Or tragedy?
 
                       DWARF
          Comedy, majesty.
 
                       ELIZABETH
                 (delighted)
A comedy!
                       (MORE)

                               ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                      (beat)
By whom?
 
                            DWARF
               By... Anonymous, your majesty...
 
                             ELIZABETH
               Anonymous...?
(then)
Oh, but I do so admire his verse...
 
Elizabeth lets go of Essex, and offers her hand to the
Dwarf, who smiles brightly.
 
                            ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
               Lead us to this gift.
 
And the Dwarf leads Elizabeth towards the door. Essex
follows, and Southampton locks into step next to him.
They exchange a knowing look as--
 
Robert Cecil steps in line far after the Queen, not
happy with this turn of events as we hear--
 
                            "QUINCE" (O.S.)
               Bless thee, Bottom! Bless thee!      Thou
art translated!
 
                                                           CUT TO:

 
23   EXT. THE GROUNDS AT CECIL HOUSE - NIGHT                          23

Sheer magic. Candles everywhere: in stakes, in the
ground, in the trees. They light a make-shift "stage"
surrounded by huge oak trees on three sides.
 
                            "BOTTOM"
               I see their knavery: this is to make
an ass of me; to fright me, if they
could. But I will not stir from this
place, do what they can.
 
Chairs have been brought out and put in rows in the
grass. Elizabeth is watching center front row (of
course). She loves it, SQUEALING in delight like a
young woman. Essex is next to her.
 
 
 
 
                                                                     24

ON STAGE

Several actors are mid-scene in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" (Act 3, Scene 1), their make-up quite elaborate
and fantastical: "Bottom", who is costumed as a man--
except that he has a DONKEY'S HEAD, "Quince", a
commoner, "Puck", played by the dwarf who is now
dressed like a cupid, and "Titania", Queen of the
fairies, who is presently asleep in a bed of fur. Puck
hides behind a tree watching.
 
                         "BOTTOM" (CONT'D)
            I will walk up and down here, and I
will sing, that they shall hear I am
not afraid.
 
BACKSTAGE

Oxford watches from behind a curtain, carefully
observing the Queen's reaction. Somehow we feel that
seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep
emotion in him.
 
ON STAGE

                         "BOTTOM" (CONT'D)
                   (sings)
The ousel cock so black of hue,
With orange-tawny bill,
The throstle with his note so true,
The wren with little quill--
 
Titania awakens in her nest-like bed of fur.
 
                         "TITANIA"
            What angel wakes me from my flow'ry
bed?
 
ELIZABETH

strongly reacts to Titania awakening.   It stirs some
memory in her. A pleasant memory.
 
OXFORD

watches, delighted by her reaction.
 
FROM HIS POV

We see Elizabeth watching. But it is an Elizabeth only
26 years old (referred to as YOUNG ELIZABETH in this
script). We HEAR the sound of other dialogue, but from
the same play. We are:
 
 
                                                            25
                                                      pg. 26
 
 
24   INT. HEDINGHAM CASTLE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT                    24

Thirty-eight years earlier. And YOUNG ELIZABETH watches
an earlier, slightly less sophisticated staging of "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" (the costumes and sets are a
bit more thrown together).
 
All the actors are children from 7-12 years old or so.
 
     FROM BACKSTAGE

A boy watches in the exact same position as we just saw
Oxford. This is BOY OXFORD-- now only 10 years old.
But he is made up and wears a winged costume for the
character of "Puck".
 
                             "OBERON" (O.S.)
                ...and the owner of it blest ever
shall in safety rest. Trip away; make
no stay;
meet me all by break of day.
 
And the characters of "Oberon" and "Titania" exit.     Boy
Oxford hurries--
 
     ON STAGE

                             "PUCK"
                If we shadows have offended, think but
this, and all is mended, that you have
but slumber'd here while these visions
did appear...
 
Next to Young Elizabeth, JOHN DE VERE, Oxford's father,
also watches, his face beaming with pride.
 
                             "PUCK" (CONT'D)
                ...And this weak and idle theme, No
more yielding but a dream, gentles, do
not reprehend; if you pardon, we will
mend.
 
     A STERN LOOKING MAN

is watching a few seats   away from Young Elizabeth.   He
is WILLIAM CECIL (40's,   Robert's father). He is a
Puritan, dressed all in   black (with a white lace
collar), and has a long   beard. He is frowning,
loathing the play.
 
 
 
 
                                                                  26

     ON STAGE

                             "PUCK" (CONT'D)
                So, good night unto you all. Give me
your hands, if we be friends, and
Robin shall restore amends.
 
The play now over, Young Elizabeth applauds with
delight, as do the small group of courtiers all around
her.
 
                               YOUNG ELIZABETH
                Lovely.    Lovely!
 
                                                         CUT TO:

 
25   INT. HEDINGHAM CASTLE - KITCHEN - LATER                        25

A make-shift "back-stage" where all the young "actors"
are removing their costumes and make-up, including Boy
Oxford, who sits in front of a make-shift, leaning
mirror.
 
Much excited talking and commotion, until Boy Oxford
notices everyone has gone silent. He turns-- his winged
costume still on-- just as--
 
                               YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                Ah!    There he is.
 
Young Elizabeth and her senior Court, including William
Cecil and John De Vere, have entered.
 
Boy Oxford bows deeply.
 
                             YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                       (to Boy Oxford)
Your father tells me you wrote this
evening's play yourself.
 
Boy Oxford glances at his father-- should he answer
directly? His father NODS.
 
                             BOY OXFORD
                I did indeed, your majesty.
 
                             YOUNG ELIZABETH
                You sport with me.
(smiling)
Compose something.
 
                               BOY OXFORD
                Now?
 
                                                                   27

                        YOUNG ELIZABETH
          Yes.   Now.
 
                       BOY OXFORD
          On what subject, your grace?
 
She thinks.   Then--
 
                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
                 (smiles)
Truth...
 
                       BOY OXFORD
                 (thinks, then--)
For... Truth... is Truth...
Though... never so old...
and time cannot make that false,
which once was true.
 
She smiles, claps.
 
                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
                 (to John de Vere)
My lord of Oxford. It seems you have
added a poet to your family's long
line of warriors.
 
                       BOY OXFORD
          Madam, I am as accomplished with the
sword and the musket as I am with
verse.
 
                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
                 (amused)
Are you indeed?
 
                       BOY OXFORD
                 (nods seriously)
It is my only desire to one day be
your majesty's most trusted servant in
matters both of war and state, if you
will but have me.
 
                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
                 (charmed)
Why, Lord Cecil, it seems we may very
well have found your replacement.
 
                       WILLIAM CECIL
          We hope not too soon, majesty, we hope
not too soon.
 
 
 
 
                                                           28

                            YOUNG ELIZABETH
                      (teasing)
And how liked you our young lord's
play, William?
 
William Cecil stiffens in discomfort.
 
                            YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                      (to Boy Oxford,
conspiratorially)
Our Lord Cecil is our most religious
of subjects, and no doubt thinks your
little masque will deliver your soul
straight into the arms of Lucifer
himself. Don't you, William?
 
The Boy Oxford looks at William Cecil, perplexed by
such a thing.
 
                            WILLIAM CECIL
               That is God's decision, your majesty.
Not mine.
 
William Cecil looks directly at John de Vere resulting
in an uncomfortable silence.
 
Elizabeth notices.
 
                            YOUNG ELIZABETH
               Well, if plays are indeed such a sin,
I pray I do not find my salvation
until very late in life.
 
Boy Oxford smiles.   He might very well be in love.

Thirty-eight years later. The door SWEEPS open and a
snoring, sleeping Jonson is awakened by--
 
                              GUARD (O.S.)
               Jonson!    Ben Jonson!
 
The other prisoners make way as the guard approaches
Jonson. The guard tosses a wax-sealed piece of
parchment onto Jonson's lap.
 
                            GUARD (CONT'D)
               You've been released.
 
Jonson looks at it, confused.
 
                                                                  29

                                GUARD (CONT'D)
                   Got powerful friends, now, don't you?
 
 
26A   EXT. A BOAT - RIVER THAMES - DAY                                26A

Jonson is in a nobleman's longboat (for the first time
in his life). Across from him sits FRANCESCO--
Italian, 60's-- wearing a doublet with the Oxford coat
of arms on its chest.
 
The City of London is far in the distance.
 
Jonson looks around uncomfortably at the luxurious boat
for a moment before--
 
                                JONSON
                   And who are you?
 
Francesco just stares back.
 
                                JONSON (CONT'D)
                   And where are we going?
 
Francesco is silent.
 
      WIDER

The boat approaches a large stone house, Oxford Stone.
 
                                                            CUT TO:

      A RED ROSE

as it is cut from its bush by ink-stained hands.       We
are:
 
 
27    EXT. OXFORD STONE - GARDEN - DAY                                 27

Oxford smells the rose, inhaling its essence. Then he
turns and sees Francesco escorting Ben Jonson towards
him.
 
Before they reach him he glances at his wife ANNE De
Vere (40's) who sits in the distance knitting with one
of their daughter's, BRIDGET (17).
 
Jonson is quite uncomfortable to be at such a grand
place. Jonson CLEARS his throat.
 
                                JONSON
                   My lord...
 
 
                                                                      30

                       OXFORD
          The Tudor rose. The most beautiful of
flowers, don't you think?
 
                       JONSON
          It looks to me to have quite a number
of thorns, my lord.
 
                        OXFORD
          So it does.   So it does.
 
                       JONSON
          I am told, my lord, that I owe my
freedom to you.
 
                       OXFORD
          That is true. And it was quite hard
to come by. One does not cross my
father-in-law lightly.
 
Jonson doesn't know who he is talking about.
 
                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
          Lord William Cecil. I have the
questionable distinction of being
married to his only daughter.
 
Oxford looks over to his wife who watches them
suspiciously. He begins to walk away forcing Jonson and
Francesco to follow.
 
                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
          It did, however, serve as helpful when
I wrote to your jailers to release you
in my father-in-law's name.
 
Jonson suddenly looks worried and turns and looks back
to Anne.
 
                       JONSON
                 (in a panicked whisper)
My lord-- I'm sorry, does that mean my
release is not officially sanctioned?
 
                        OXFORD
          Don't be an idiot Jonson, of course it
wasn't.
(beat)
But you are free, are you not?
 
They have come to an entrance to a GARDEN MAZE and Anne
watches them as they disappear into the maze.

Oxford turns to Jonson.
 
                            OXFORD
               I enjoyed your little comedy last
week, Jonson. You have potential,
great potential.
 
                            JONSON
               Thank you, my lord.
 
                            OXFORD
               But it's politics did seem to have
quite an effect on the Tower. My
father-in-law's men felt it quite
seditious.
 
                            JONSON
               Politics? My play had nothing to do
with politics! It was just a simple
comedy--
 
                             OXFORD
               That showed your betters as fools who
go through life barely managing to get
food from plate to mouth, were it not
for the cleverness of their servants.
(beat)
All art is political, Jonson.
Otherwise it would just be decoration.
And all artists have something to say,
otherwise... they'd make shoes. And
you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson?
 
As they enter the center of the maze, Oxford turns to
his servant.
 
                               OXFORD (CONT'D)
                      (nods)
Francesco.
 
Francesco steps forward and hands Jonson a leather
bound manuscript. Jonson looks at it confused and
opens it.
 
                            JONSON
               A play, my lord?
 
                            OXFORD
               One you shall stage Bankside.
 
                               JONSON
               Stage?
 
                                                              32
                                                  pg. 33
 
 
                       OXFORD
          Under your name.
 
                       JONSON
          My name, my lord?
 
                       OXFORD
          I can't very well use my name, can I?
I'm the seventeenth Earl of Oxford.
The Lord Great Chamberlain of England,
Viscount Bolebec, Lord Escales,
Sandford and Badlesmere, etc, etc.
No. I have a... reputation to
protect. In my world, one does not
write plays, Jonson. People like you
do.
 
Jonson tries not to be offended.
 
                       JONSON
          Yes. My lord. You wrote an entire
play, my lord. I know how difficult--
 
                       OXFORD
          Not a play, Jonson, I've written many.
No doubt, many more than you yourself.
A good number performed at Court years
ago, others never seen by a living
soul.
 
                       JONSON
          And you want... me to apply my name to
this play?
 
                       OXFORD
          No. I mean you to put your name to
all of them.
 
                         JONSON
          All of them?
 
                       OXFORD
          Well don't look like I just gutted
your pet dog, Jonson. I mean to make
you the most popular-- and therefore
the most monetarily successful--
playwright in all of London.
 
Jonson pales.   This is a disaster for him.
 
                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
          I wish you god speed and good morrow.
 
Jonson looks down at the manuscript, reads a few lines.
 
                                                           33
                                                      pg. 34
 
 
                            JONSON
               My lord-- I really--
 
He looks up, but Oxford is gone, having left the maze
without so much as a good-bye.
 
                              JONSON (CONT'D)
               My lord?
 
But before he can follow, Francesco tosses a leather
pouch of coins at his feet.
 
                            FRANCESCO
               That is for your trouble, Signor
Jonson. And your silence. If I hear
you break that silence, then... not so
good for Signor Jonson.
 
And Francesco follows after his master as Jonson picks
up the pouch, examining its contents.
 
And then Jonson realizes he doesn't know how to get out
of the maze. He chases after them.
 
                             JONSON
               Hello?   My lord?! I--
 
And he's lost. He looks this way and that, then picks
a path (the wrong one).
 
 
29   EXT. CECIL HOUSE - DAY                                      29

Robert Cecil is standing at the opulent river   entrance
to Cecil House, waiting for an enormous barge   docking.
William Cecil (now 75) is at the front of the   barge,
waiting to disembark. He constantly holds an    ornately
carved white cane.
 
                            WILLIAM CECIL
               So! I am gone for three days, and you
somehow manage to let her spend all of
them solely in the company of the Earl
of Essex...
 
Robert Cecil looks at him sharply.   How did he know.
 
                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
               Don't think because I was in London, I
didn't know exactly what went on here
in my absence.
 
 
 
 
                                                                34
                                                      pg. 35
 
 
                            ROBERT CECIL
               He is an Earl, father. I cannot deny
him--
 
                             WILLIAM CECIL
               Of course not! You don't deny him
anything. You find excuses. She is
unwell, she is reading, she is seeing
the Ambassador from Russia. For God's
sake, use your imagination, Robert.
Whatever will you do when I am gone?
(beat)
We will have to deal with Essex soon.
His ambitions are becoming a nuisance.
 
 
30   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                           30

William Cecil enters an impressive hallway and turns to
his son.
 
 
                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Now tell me about the play.
 
Robert Cecil looks surprised for an instant that he
knows about that as well.
 
                            ROBERT CECIL
               It-- it was an anonymous gift. Essex
insisted it be performed, just to
spite me in front of Court...
 
                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Of course he did.
(concerned)
But what was it about?
 
                            ROBERT CECIL
               About? Some nonsense about fairies
and cherubs.
 
                            WILLIAM CECIL
               ...And dancing asses?
 
Robert looks surprised at his father who has stopped
suddenly.
 
                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
                      (realizing, to himself)
Edward...
(to Robert Cecil)
Have you any idea what you have-- No,
how could you...
 
                                                               35
                                                    pg. 36
 
 
And he starts back up the stairs.
 
                              ROBERT CECIL
               Father...    It was just a play...
 
                             WILLIAM CECIL
               And do you know how long it took me to
banish them from her presence? She
adores them! Adores them! And Edward
knows it.
(beat)
Mark my words, Robert, he has done
this for a purpose.
 
                              ROBERT CECIL
               Purpose?    What purpose?
 
                            WILLIAM CECIL
                      (thinking, to himself)
What purpose indeed?
(to Robert)
But through your carelessness I must
now deal not only with Essex, but
Edward as well. For whether in shadow
or in person, Edward has returned to
Court!
 
And with that he slams the door shut.
 
Robert Cecil walks over to a nearby window. Visibly
upset he starts to stare out of the window and
remembers...
 
                                                        CUT TO:

 
31   OMIT                                                          31

     THROUGH A THIRD STORY WINDOW

We see servants carrying big trunks. There are at least
120 men on horses. They all wear the Oxford's crest.
 
                             WILLIAM CECIL (O.S)
               Robert.
 
 
32   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                              32

And it is thirty years earlier.
 
BOY ROBERT CECIL (now 9) is staring out of the window.
His back must have been deformed either in utero or at
birth, because even now he is hunchbacked.
 
                                                                  36
                                                   pg. 37
 
 
                       WILLIAM CECIL(O.S.)
                 (more commanding)
Robert! Come here.
 
Finally Boy Robert Cecil turns and sees Young Oxford
(now 17) entering the hallway with William Cecil and
his wife and daughter, Young ANNE (15). In front of
them, lined up, are several men whom we will learn are
TUTORS.

Boy Robert Cecil doesn't move.
 
                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
                 (to Young Oxford)
I am sorry, my lord. But my son
Robert prefers the company... of
himself...
 
Boy Robert Cecil watches as his father turns to his
mother and sister.
 
                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
          May I present my wife, Lady Cecil, and
my daughter, Anne.
 
Young Anne curtsies.
 
                       YOUNG ANNE
          I am sorry for your loss, my lord.
The realm lost a great lord with your
father's death. We hope you will be
happy in our house--
 
                       BOY ROBERT CECIL (O.S.)
          Are you going to live here forever?
 
Everybody turns and sees the odd hunchback child has
finally come over.
 
                         YOUNG OXFORD
                   (smiles)
No.    Only until I reach my maturity.
 
                        BOY ROBERT CECIL
          Why?
 
                       WILLIAM CECIL
          Because the Queen has bade it so.
(to Young Oxford)
My lord, when we first met, you said
you wished to become a great man of
State. Both the Queen and I hope to
make that so.
                       (MORE)

                                                            37
                                                 pg. 38
 
                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
          To that end, I have the honor of
introducing you to your tutors.
(indicates one of them)
Seven to eight you shall be tutored in
French by Mister Crane--
 
                      YOUNG OXFORD
          Monsieur. Ca me fait plaisir de vous
connaitre.
 
Master Crane bows his head.
 
                       WILLIAM CECIL
          Nine to ten is Greek with Mister
Simmons.
 
                       YOUNG OXFORD
                 (in Greek)
Dalon, an d'ego, hoti mathamata ge
esti ha trafo psychas.
 
                       BOY ROBERT CECIL
          Is that Homer?
 
                        YOUNG OXFORD
                  (sharp)
No.   Plato.
 
Boy Robert frowns at the correction.
 
                       WILLIAM CECIL
                 (slight frown, then)
And you know your uncle, Mister
Golding, who has petitioned me to
allow you to assist him in his
translations of ancient Latin texts
into English.
 
                       YOUNG OXFORD
                 (in Latin)
Continetne, ut spero, Ovidii
Metamorphose? Mihi honori erit,
patrue
 
Mister Golding bows his head in appreciation.
 
                       WILLIAM CECIL
          Then cosmography with Doctor Richards.
Two to three is geography and history,
and four to five fencing.
 
William Cecil seems to have finished.
 
 
 
                                                          38
                                                       pg. 39
 
 
                            YOUNG OXFORD
                      (to William Cecil)
And composition? Poetry?
 
                            WILLIAM CECIL
               This is a Puritan home, your grace.
We believe such activities to be the
worship of false idols, and therefore
a sin before the eyes of God.
 
                            YOUNG OXFORD
               A sin? But surely there must be room
for beauty and art in life, my lord.
 
                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Not in this household.
 
 
33   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY                         33

Young Oxford is fencing with a tutor. He's quite good.
In fact, he's better than the tutor, who is twice his
age.
 
Boy Robert Cecil casually watches as he plays chess
against himself.
 
Young Oxford, with a fierce, beautifully executed
attack, disarms his tutor. The tutor's sword FLIES
into the air, and hits--
 
     THE CHESS BOARD

making the pieces scatter.
 
     WIDER

Boy Robert Cecil looks up, his face furious, to see
Young Oxford coming over to him.
 
                            YOUNG OXFORD
               You were losing anyway.
 
                            BOY ROBERT CECIL
               I was also winning.
 
Young Oxford picks up the sword, throws it to his
tutor, who catches it.
 
                            BOY ROBERT CECIL

               You know I am going to one day succeed
my father at the Queen's side. Not
you.
 
                                                                39
                                                    pg. 40
 
 
Young Oxford motions to go, then picks up the black
king, and tosses it to Boy Robert Cecil, who can't
catch it because of his deformity. It CLANGS on the
floor.
 
                            YOUNG OXFORD
                 Really?
 
 
34   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                           34

Moments later, the Young Oxford heads down the hall
alone, heading for his rooms, his sword still in his
hand.
 
                                                     CUT TO:

     POEMS

neatly written on parchment.   We are:
 
 
35   INT. CECIL HOUSE - YOUNG OXFORD'S ROOM - DAY               35

And a SERVANT is looking at the poems, then quickly
stuffing them into a bag.
 
But then he HEARS footsteps coming. Panicked, he looks
for someplace to hide-- a tapestry half covers a door--
he runs to it-- the door is locked!
 
So he hides behind the tapestry just as the door opens,
and Young Oxford enters.
 
After a few steps, Young Oxford senses something amiss.
Looks at his--
 
     WRITING DESK

where the parchments are scattered.
 
     YOUNG OXFORD

goes to his desk, picks up one of the pieces of
parchment. It has poetry on it. His poetry. He goes
through some other pages. And realizes other pages are
missing. He becomes infuriated. He sees--
 
     UNDER THE TAPESTRY

Two feet.
 
 
 
 
                                                               40

     WIDER

Young Oxford CHARGES the tapestry, sword in hand.     He
THRUSTS the sword THROUGH the tapestry.
 
The man screams in agony as he falls. He doesn't just
die, but screams and screams and screams.
 
Young Oxford steps back-- half in horror... half in
triumph. The SOUND of APPLAUSE takes us to:
 
 
36   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DAY                      36

Thirty-three years later.
 
Shakespeare is on stage, taking a bow. The audience is
APPLAUDING and SCREAMING their approval of a
performance that has just ended. He steps backwards--
 
     BACKSTAGE

--where Jonson stands holding the manuscript Oxford
gave him.
 
                              SHAKESPEARE
                 Is it any good?
 
                              JONSON
                 How in blazes should I know?
 
                              SHAKESPEARE
                 You haven't even read it?
 
And Shakespeare is drawn back--
 
     ON STAGE

--where he bows again, then steps--
 
     BACKSTAGE

--so Jonson can answer him.
 
                              JONSON
                 I read a line or two-- I promised
Henslowe I'd finish "Eastward Ho" by
Saturday.
 
                              SHAKESPEARE
                 And you say he's a nobleman?
 
Jonson doesn't answer.
 
 
                                                                 41
                                                       pg. 42
 
 
                             SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
