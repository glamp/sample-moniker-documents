| Why is it 'work-in-progress' you might ask? Well for one, this    |
| isn't a 100% accurate transcript: some words might be missing,    |
| may not be right. Second, some lines may or may not have been     |
| spoken by the right character. There are instances in the film    |
| where a line is spoken but the character isn't on screen, which   |
| makes things complicated. But I'd say this transcript is about    |
| 98-99% accurate. Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line   |
| of equal signs (=).                                               |
|                                                                   |

| any. What you CAN'T do, however, is to edit it and take credit    |
| for it. Although I do not own the movie or it's screenplay, this |
| transcript was made with no intention of copyright infringement |
| and the like. Enjoy. And remember: 'Fish are friends, not food'. |
