    FADE IN:


PHOTOGRAPHIC STILLS show us NICOLA TOSCANI as a city boy in
various growing-up SHOTS, circa 1950's -- with street chums
wearing a Wyatt Earp T-shirt, in a communion suit. Then:
in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he
grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his
name on contest posters, SHOTS of him in action. Then:
Japan. Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters,
being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese
martial artists, then himself as an instructor. Now: a
few military uniforms enter the picture, we see security
clearance documents with Nico's picture and name on them.
Then Nico near draft age with an American friend NELSON
FOX on some kind of training base. TITLES END.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

    Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT
CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH.
SUPER:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage
whips in the fierce downdraft as --
3   "HUEY" GUNSHIP
    with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper
lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the
wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several
machine gun positions around the LZ.
4   EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY
    watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico
and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary
jungle attire that usually marks a CIA "spook."

5   HELICOPTER
    touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in
their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags
-- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the
ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before.

6   LEADER OF THREE

wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45.
7   NICO AND FOX

don't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness.



                                FOX
                  You ever see chemical interrogation
before?

Nico's eyes stay on the approaching "cowboy," KURT ZAGON,
for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity.
                                NICO
                  These assholes are agency?

8    NICO'S POV
     FOLLOWS the medical bag in the cowboy's hand.

9    BACK TO FOX AND NICO

                  We're all C.I.A. But these guys are
from a page that ain't on the map.
10   EXT. JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
     Nico in the point,   leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical
Interrogation Team)   men down an unmarked, twisting trail.
We see from Nico's   gait that he is athletic, a born leader
and totally at home   in the jungle.
11   TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON
     snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and
let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.
                                ZAGON
                  How long till we're across the border?
                                NICO
                  We've been over for the past hour.
The group continues along the ridge.

                                                   CUT TO:


The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks.
13   NICO

listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back
at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette.
                                ZAGON
                  What are you looking at, hotshot?

                                NICO
                         (indicates cigarette
glow)
Why don't you light a bonfire?



Irritably, Zagon ditches his smoke.
                             ZAGON
               Just drive the taxi, ace.

As the party moves out, Fox flashes Nico a look as if to say,
"Don't fuck with these guys."

14   EXT. CAMBODIAN BASE CAMP - NIGHT

A pocket-fortified position. Armed Cambodian lookouts,
several hooches, radio equipment. Nico leads the party in
through the perimeter. Zagon eyes the layout like he's seen
100 of them. Fox indicates a hooch.
                             FOX
                      (to Zagon)
They're in there.

The three CIT men start for the hooch. Nico casts a concerned
glance around at the base camp troops, looking sloppy as hell.
                             NICO
               I don't trust these yo-yo's.
15   FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP
     We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position
to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him
ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.

16   DEFENSIVE POSITION - NICO
     hears a SOUND, looks back toward the hooch.
17   NICO'S POV - HOOCH
     Two Asian prisoners, stripped to the waist, babbling in-
coherently, are dragged out the back by a pair of Cambodian
guards and hustled off into the darkness. VOICES can be
heard inside the hooch. A single lantern glowing inside
gives the hut a creepy, frightening aspect.

18   BACK TO NICO
     He's extremely uneasy about what's about to happen inside the
hooch.

19   INT. HOOCH - CLOSE ON RICKETY CARD TABLE - NIGHT
     on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes, drug vials
and surgical instruments. Zagon's hand picks up a hypodermic,
squirt-tests it.



20   TWO ASIAN PRISONERS
     are on their knees, shirtless, handcuffed with heavy nylon
tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the
hooch. One of the subordinate CIT men moves in, grabs the
first prisoner by the shoulders. Zagon injects the first
prisoner. Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing.
Zagon watches with professional satisfaction.

                               ZAGON
                 That's the nice thing about modern
technology. You don't have to wait
for results.

He moves close to the first prisoner.
                               ZAGON
                        (to first prisoner)
Where is it, Charley? You got six tons
of our shit --
The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all
that comes out is a blood-curdling wail --
21   EXT. BAST CAMP - NICO

hears this horrifying cry.   He starts swiftly toward the
hooch --
22   INT. HOOCH - INTERPRETER

has moved as close to Zagon and the first prisoner as a fight
referee to two boxers. The prisoner is convulsing wildly.
Zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair.
                               ZAGON
                 Don't you die on me, fucker --
                               FOX
                        (from the side)
What the hell's wrong?
                               ZAGON
                        (throws the prisoner
down)
This pussy can't hold his liquor.

The first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm.

23   NICO
     enters at this point. He takes in the scene quickly, moves
to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn't look at Nico,
but it's plain he is aware of Nico's presence. It is as if
he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove
it to the others, too.

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                         5.

24   FIRST PRISONER
     dies in agony on the ground.

25   SECOND PRISONER
     watches with eyes like flint. He is in his mid-forties,
scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or
higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes
since the French in the 50's. He is plainly one tough
customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if
daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the
prisoner with barely contained hatred. The prisoner doesn't
back down an inch.
                             ZAGON
                      (to second prisoner)
So my little doctor bag doesn't                      *
scare you, eh? Well I don't need                     *
it to open your yap.                                 *
Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a
fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and
a scalpel. He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the
blade in the lantern light.

26   NICO
     watches impassively.
                             ZAGON (O.S.)
                      (to prisoner)
Where's our load, you sack of slime?
What did you do with my shit? --
27   ZAGON
     punches  the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife
handle  in his fist to double the force of the blow and to
terrify  him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner
crashes  sideways, face bloody --
                             ZAGON
               I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna
teach you never to fuck with my
opium --

28   FOX AND TWO CIT MEN

seem to know exactly what this is about.
29   NICO

didn't know, but the new kid on the block is catching on fast.
Nico has difficulty containing his emotion. Zagon stands
over the prisoner, as if daring him to get back up.



The prisoner gets back to his knees, bloody eyes meeting
Zagon's with defiance --

                       ZAGON
                (to prisoner)
You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy?
You took it from the Chinks... you took
it from the French. You'll be fucked
if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start
your gums flapping --
Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the
prisoner.

                       ZAGON
         -- Well, you're gonna chirp for me,
tough guy. You're gonna sing like a
choir --

Nico takes a step toward Zagon.
                       NICO
         What the fuck does this have to do
with military intelligence?
                       ZAGON
         Your orders are 'assist and observe'
cherry --
Zagon turns to face Nico --

                       FOX
                (to Nico)
Back off, partner --
Zagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner,
close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.
                       ZAGON
                (to second prisoner)
I'm gonna start carving at your ankles.
We'll throw your feet in that box right
over there. Then I'm gonna take off
your arms --
One of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping
it to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't
flinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as
Zagon.
                         NICO
                  (can't take
much more)
Fox --
                       FOX
         Shut up, Nico.



                             ZAGON
               You can disappear as easy as this
slope, kid --

Zagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade.
Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with
terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico.
Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a
ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally
comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops
in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men
move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing
his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico
out of the hooch --
30   EXT. HOOCH - NIGHT

Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch --

                             FOX
               Are you crazy?!!
(as Nico jerks free)
What the fuck's the matter with you?!!!
Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps
away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his
.45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the
hooch --
                            FOX
               Nico!
                             NICO
               I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me
later.

The last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway.
Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again --

                             FOX
               I'll cover this. Get back to the
               L.Z. --
                      (as Nico resists)
-- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the
fuck outa here!
The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect,
pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to
seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect,
apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The
troops, confused, hold up for a moment.

                             FOX
                      (to Nico)
I'll call for a chopper... get outa
here!

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        8.

Nico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle
trail. Fox seems abandoned. The DISTANT BOMBING CONTINUES.
Nico disappears into the darkness.

                                                FADE TO BLACK.


31   CHURCH STEEPLE - DAY

TILT DOWN to reveal St. Elizabeth's, a huge parish church in
an Italian/Latino neighborhood in Chicago. The church looks
festive, we see a few formally-dressed people hurrying in,
then a squad car pulls up. The cops run upstairs as if
they're late --
32   INT. ST. MARY'S - DAY

A baptism in progress. Nico -- 15 years older than when we
last saw him, is standing beside SARA, his lovely wife        *
-- watching a 60-ish priest, FATHER GENARRO, finish the
final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest
straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth
around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and
relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in
uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro
with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's
garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from
all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm
around Sara.                                                  *

33   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
     Huge trays of Italian delicacies are carried out into the
sunlight by several "old country"-type women. Wine is
poured from generous carafes. Friends and relatives are
everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently
the party has come here straight from the church. Presents
for the new baby are being opened by Nico's wife, Sara,        *
and Nico's mother, ROSA.
                             SARA                                   *
               Mama, look at this -- all done by hand.

Sara lifts a cute baby outfit.                                 *
                             ROSA
               Nico had one just like this.   Thank
you, Cora.
Cora, an aunt, proudly smiles.

34   NICO

Holding the baby. Realizes that his little son has pooped
in his pants. He turns for help to Sara.                       *

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           9.

                                NICO
                  I think we got a little problem here.

                                SARA                                  *
                         (winking at the women)
I carried him for the last nine months,
you take him for the next diaper.

Assorted uncles and aunts watch with amusement as Nico tries
awkwardly to deal with the problem.
                                NICO
                         (to all)
That's what you get for not marrying a
Sicilian.
Sara lets Nico struggle a moment, then takes over.               *

                             SARA                                     *
               My brave husband. He's not afraid of
thieves and muggers, but he's terrified
when his son poops in his pants.
Toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple
and their baby.

35   ANOTHER PART OF BACK YARD
     Three Chicago cops, LUKICH and HENDERSON in plain clothes
and LIEUTENANT STROZAH in uniform wolf some Italian goodies
while eying the group of celebrating relatives.
                                LUKICH
                         (indicates Nico
across the patio)
Toscani holds the record... for havin'
more relatives under federal indictment
than any other cop in Chicago.

36   TWO OF NICO'S UNCLES
     BRANCA and LUIGI, who   look like they have been on the other
side of a cop's work,   are in turn eying Lukich and Henderson
-- plus a cluster of   other cops in civvies hovering around
the buffet table like   vultures.
                                BRANCA
                  Look at these stiff dicks. A free meal
and they come out like flies.
37   STREET OUTSIDE NICO'S HOUSE - DAY

An unmarked police car pulls up. DOLORES JACKSON ("Jax"),
another undercover cop, tall, black, and elegant, enters
the driveway leading to Nico's back yard --

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                         10.

38   BACK YARD
     Jackson enters. She's impeccably dressed and radiates
intelligence. She's greeted warmly by Lukich, Henderson,
Strozah, and a couple of other cops.
                               STROZAH
                 I didn't do nothing, Counselor.    I'm
clean.

                               JACKSON
                 Eight more days, Lieutenant. You
better start preparing your defense.

                               HENDERSON
                 Baby, I'm gonna put you on retainer.

                               LUKICH
                 You passed the bar? I make it a
point never to pass the bar.
Jackson sees Nico and Sara across the yard, waves and          *
starts toward them --
39   BACK TO BRANCA AND LUIGI

Luigi indicates Jackson as she crosses the patio.
                                 LUIGI
                 Now this cop.    She can bust me any
day.
40   NICK, SARA AND ROSA (NICO'S MOTHER)                            *
     Jackson comes up, makes a theatrical appreciation of Nico's
stylish attire, kisses Sara and greets Nico's mom warmly.      *
She starts oohing and ahhing over the baby.
41   VARIOUS SHOTS

Young kids playing on the lawn, more guests arriving, Father
Genarro dancing with an elderly matron. We see that Nico's
friends are an electric mix. Cops, art-y types, people of
varied ages and professions.
42   BACK TO JACKSON

Holding the baby.

                               JACKSON
                 Look at this little bundle.    What a
cupcake!

                               NICO
                 You give up being the D.A. and hurry
up and find the right fella, Jax.
You might have time for one of these
yourself.

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        10A.

                            SARA                                    *
              Nico, will you let the woman
catch her breath?

43   JAPANESE WOMAN (DR. WATANABE)                                  *
     moves in shyly on the fringe of the cluster. While Jackson
and Sara continue their "mom" talk, Nico edges off toward      *
Watanabe, shaking her hand with real pleasure.                 *

                             NICO
              Watanabe!   Say hey, Doc.

They begin jabbering in Japanese.
We will meet Watanabe again later. She's a brainy-looking      *
woman -- reserved, a bit mysterious -- who talks quietly and   *
intensely in Japanese with Nico like they're old friends who
go back a long way.

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                        11.      *

44   EXT. TOSCANI FRONT PORCH - LATER
     Branca, Luigi and several other Toscani patriarchs smoke
cigars and sip beer in a cluster. Nico holds Julian.

                            BRANCA
              You're a father now. Are you gonna

                            NICO
              I'm happy, Branca.    I like what I do.
Branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a
smile, pats Nico's cheek.
                            BRANCA
              Look at this face! Six-foot-four,
pretty as the statue of David. And
he's a cop!
Branca laughs. From a distance, Watanabe watches, missing
nothing. Across the porch, Lukich and several other cops
observe and try to listen.
                            BRANCA
              This face should be sticking up from
a white shirt. It should be a banker,
a businessman, someone who earns a
decent living for his family!

              Same thing. She wants a husband who
carries a briefcase, not a shoulder
holster.
Jackson watches Nico trying to keep his good humor. This
is serious stuff, despite the light tone. Branca's eyes
meet Nico's.

Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don't
need. I'd rather get shot by someone
I don't know.
Jackson and Lukich crack up. The others follow.   For the
moment, the tension is dispelled.

45   INT. NICO'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY
     Nico comes out of the bedroom, adjusting his shoulder
holster, tugging his jacket over it. He sees his mother
standing near the head of the stairs, just outside
another bedroom door. Concern on her face.
                             NICO
               What are you doing in here, Mama?
Go join the party...
Nico comes down the hall, tucking in his shirt -- stops
to give his mother a squeeze. O.S. from the bedroom:
the sound of QUIET SOBBING. Nico glances in.
46   INT. NURSERY - DAY                                           *
     Sara and another woman sit on the bed, comforting a 60-ish   *
grandmother Zingaro, who is crying. Nico comes in. He
kneels before MRS. ZINGARO, concerned.

                             NICO
               Mrs. Z.
(tries to be light)
Is this a way to act on the day of

The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes.

               It's Lucy.   She's gone again.
Nico glances from Sara to Rosa.                              *

Mrs. Zingaro shakes her head, choked with pain. Nico
holds her, looking over her shoulder toward Sara.            *
                             NICO
               It's that kid from the bar on Damen?

Sara doesn't know. Nico does.     He comforts Mrs. Zingaro   *
another moment, then stands.

                             NICO
               Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you
listening?
(as the woman nods
miserably)
I have to go to work now. But
I'll come by tonight. You'll be
at the bakery?
                               MRS. ZINGARO
               Si, Nico.
                             NICO
               We'll talk, okay? We'll find a
way to take care of this.

Nico kisses Mrs. Z. He takes Sara's hand in goodbye,         *
starts for the door.
47   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY
     Festivities still in progress. Nico passes through,
nodding, thanking people for coming, taking farewells.
Jackson waits for him, glancing at her watch.

     Nico is driving.   Jackson checks in on the radio.

stopping at this dive for"?

                             NICO
               I gotta take a quick leak. Stay

He gets out of the car, starts for the bar.
53   INT. BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY                                 *

Dim, smoke-choked, dangerous characters at the bar.    Nico
enters.

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                            15.

His silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working-
class attire of the bar's denizens. Hard faces check him out
subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a
photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head.

                            BAD DUDE                                 *

leave me alone?                                        *

He continues mouthing off to Nico. Nico moves to one stool,     *
then another; the same exchange is repeated.
54   FAVOR ONE PARTICULARLY TOUGH CUSTOMER                           *

A hulking bruiser with an earring.   He watches as --
55   NICO

approaches him. Three ARMY JACKETS look up sullenly.
Beefy arms, tattoos, greasy mustaches.
                              NICO
              Gentlemen.
One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins
to pick his nose.
                            FIRST ARMY JACKET
                     (to others)
I thought this was a kosher bar.
They didn't allow no pork in here.
The two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar.
Nico holds out a photo of a young girl (Lucy).
                            NICO
              You seen this girl?
                            SECOND ARMY JACKET
              I seen the top of her head.
                              NICO
              That's witty.



Nico takes a step away, as if moving on to the next
stool. From behind the bar, the bartender swings a          *
sawed-off baseball bat into view. Other bodies move         *
ominously toward Nico. Suddenly he spins and, in a move     *
almost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right
out of its floor socket. Beer bottles fly, bodies crash.
Nico slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks
like his nose has exploded. Blood sprays onto Nico's silk
shirt. He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with
a shot that crushes three ribs. A savage elbow blasts the
third, head over heels, out over the bar and careening
into the sink. In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has
been put in cold storage. The rest of the bar is on its
feet. Four huge men confront Nico. Now five. Six.
Seven. Nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat-
tered; his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men --

                         NICO
          Come on.   Show me something.
No one moves.

                I get it.   It's a gay bar.   Is
that it?

The men, led by the Bad Dude, are shifting to surround
Nico. But no one attacks. Nico has Lucy's photo in his
hand. He jams it in one man's face, then another's, slap-
ping each one violently, spitting, raging for them to attack.

                              NICO
                You seen the top of her head, huh?
Like I seen your mother's --
(to another guy)
Or was it yours?
(to a third)
Or yours?
(slaps him fero-
ciously)
I couldn't tell, it looked like
her ass --
Nico rages like a beast.

               Come on, motherfuckers.    Do it.

Nico lunges for the Bad Dude, grabs him like he's about
to tear his face off --
                             BAD DUDE
               Upstairs!

She's upstairs! 4-D!
Nico drags the Dude from behind the bar.     Holding him,
Nico turns, glowering, to all.

               Wait, man.   It ain't like it

Nico grabs the Pimp by the scruff of the neck, lifting him
bodily. Lucy starts wailing in horror. Nico smashes the
Pimp's face down into a mirror with white powder on the
table --

                             NICO
               That's two years.

With infinite boredom, Jackson lifts her badge -- and
gun. The Studs shuffle away.

hauls the Pimp to his feet --

               Let him alone! He's beautiful!

               No, man, wait! I'll give you

               This is square! On my mother's
soul! You can't send me up --
Nico glances to Lucy. Half of him wants to tear the
Pimp apart, the other half doesn't want to make the poor
girl's life any more tragic. Besides, he's a good cop
-- and maybe this "shipment" is on the level.
                             PIMP
               I heard it from a hooker friend

     Jackson looks up from the car to see Nico -- wild-haired,
shirt ripped and bloody -- emerging from the adjacent
apartment stoop, leading young Lucy, who's tear-streaked,
wearing a torn dressing gown. Instantly, Jackson is out
of the car, moving to Lucy.

                             JACKSON
               It's okay, girl. Mama Jax is
here.

She wraps an arm around Lucy, helps her toward the car.

                      (to Nico)
That was some leak you took.
From the door of the bar, several bloodied heads peek.

               Broken windows and lost pussy cats,

Jackson checks out her battered partner.

From the front seat of Nico's car emerges a tearful Lucy,
in fresh clothes and looking miserably contrite. Nico
walks her inside.

The Zingaro family is busy preparing for the night's baking.
Grandpa and Grandma Zingaro leave their work and receive
their waif-like granddaughter. With eyes watering they
thank Nico. They disappear upstairs with Lucy. Jackson,
standing in the doorway, has seen all this.
64   INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY

Nico at the wheel has just pulled away from the bakery.
Jackson, in the passenger seat, studies her partner for a
few moments, shaking her head at the contradictions in this
man. Educated, classy, an elegant dresser -- yet underneath
an out-and-out wild man.

                             JACKSON
               I don't get you, Toscani.
(beat)
What the hell are you doing being a
shitheel cop? With your background?
For a long moment Nico says nothing.   Then, quietly, look-
ing straight ahead:

               When I was overseas, I saw some

He turns to Jackson.
                             NICO
               You can walk away from them, Jax.
You can quit, but you know it's
still going on. You try something
anyway --

the world. I can't stop the tonnage
coming in, I can't fight the boys

He turns a corner.

name of your boyfriend --
                             CARLA
               I got 200 boyfriends.
The hooker, Carla DeCarlo, slaps the box away, cursing in
Spanish.



                             CARLA
               Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon!

Some of the chocolates tumble onto the lockup floor, the
detainees snap them up, start munching. The girl con-
tinues to spit curses at Nico, gesturing with her hands
with Latin flamboyance. Nico grabs her by the elbow, as
a jailer opens the lockup door. More curses are being
flung at Nico from various females in the cage. Nico
heaves Carla in among them. Carla flops down on a bench
next to a tall black hooker. MOVE IN ON the black hooker.
It's Nico's partner, Jackson, dolled up like a street-
walker, playing her undercover role to the hilt.

                             JACKSON
                      (to Nico)
Why can't you sons-a-bitches ever
treat someone with a little
respect?

                      (walking away)
Take it easy, sister.
                             JACKSON
               I ain't your goddamn sister.   We
ain't got the same mother,
motherfucka.
Carla fires one final parting salvo of obscenities, then
sags back among the women. Carla starts to cry. Jackson
comforts her; Carla responds, lets herself be comforted.
                                                   CUT TO:

     Jackson, back in her normal daytime wear, exits a
building. She gets into Nico's car.

67   INT. CAR - DAY
     Jackson checks her makeup in the rearview mirror. Nico
sits behind the wheel. The two are on some kind of
stakeout.
                             JACKSON
               The lawyer's name is Abandano.
He's on the third floor. I got a
look at him. I couldn't get how
he's connected, but according to
Carla, he's a lousy lay.

                             NICO
               Maybe we can bust him for that.
Jackson spots something, gestures subtly out window --

68   EXT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - DAY
     A short, slick-looking Latin man in a business suit emerges
from the building.

                             JACKSON
               That's our stud.

Nico and Jackson leave their car and follow him on foot.

69   EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - BANK - DAY
     ABANDANO meets a striking-looking middle-aged woman in front
of a stately financial institution. They go in. Jackson
remains out on the street, while Nico follows the couple in.
70   LATER

Jackson has been waiting, sipping some coffee. Nico
emerges from the bank, signaling to his partner to follow
him. Abandano and the woman exit from the bank's revol-
ving doors and immediately jump into a cab. Nico and
Jackson look at each other and step in front of another
cab. Nico opens the cab door, flips his badge open, then
asks the occupant to leave. Jackson gets in the front
seat next to the protesting cabbie.
71   EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY
     Abandano and the woman are crossing the plaza as Nico and
Jackson run up the block. Near the entrance to the Federal     *
Building, a small but vocal group of protestors are            *
gathered, carrying signs and chanting slogans. The frus-       *
trated cabbie watches them in the background.
72   PLAZA
     Jackson and Nico watch Abandano and the woman pass the        *
crowd of demonstrators and enter the building. Jackson acts *
indifferent, almost frustrated; Nico keenly senses something.
                                                  CUT TO:

73   INT. EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT ("BOGOTA") - DAY                     *
     The main dining room. No customers, just busboys readying
tables for the evening's business. We notice one of the        *
busboys is the "pimp" Nico found with Lucy.                    *

74   BOOTH NEAR BACK HALLWAY
     The owner's table. Stacks of dining checks, a cashbox
and calculator, full ashtrays, wine glasses. BAUTISTA
SALVANO, a heavyset, swarthy Venezuelan dressed in a tux
with the collar open, glowers across the table at a mus-
cular, scar-faced Latin busboy -- the kind who looks like
he does more for his boss than clean up the tables. The
busboy (NARDO) is nervous, apologetic --

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                          23.

                            SALVANO
                     (pissed off)
-- I brought you in for your
muscles, Nardo, not your mouth.

                            NARDO
                     (scared)
I'm sorry, boss.

                            SALVANO
              Your English is getting good...
You're showing it off. Showing it
off on the street --

                              NARDO
              I keep quiet.    I never talk no
more --

Salvano glowers at Nardo like he's about to punch him.
Instead he reaches over, playfully chokes the busboy --
then releases him, as if all is forgiven.
                            SALVANO
              Make yourself useful.
(indicates empty
wine bottle on
table)
Get downstairs, bring me one of
these.
(as Nardo stands,
starts for back
hallway)
Then get back to work.
75   INT. RESTAURANT BASEMENT STOREROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Nardo enters at the top of the stairs, radiating relief.
He trots down into the empty basement, toward a floor-to-
ceiling wine rack.

                            NARDO
                     (to himself)
I thought I was dead, man.
(whistles with
relief)
I thought I was fucking dead.

He crosses to the wine rack. It's dark, hard to see.
He searches for the bottle. Suddenly: a METALLIC sound
behind him. Nardo turns -- CHI CHI TESTAMENTE, a wiry,
pock-faced Latino, stands in the shadows (it is clear he
has been waiting there, hiding) -- holding a small
silencer automatic.

                            CHI CHI
              You were right, cabron.                            *

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                           24.

One SHOT between the eyes and Nardo CRASHES backward into
the WINE RACK, eyes wide with shock and bewilderment. Chi
Chi SHOOTS him AGAIN; Nardo drops like a stone. Coolly,
professionally, Chi Chi pumps FOUR more SHOTS into the
prone busboy's head. Chi Chi ejects the clip into his
palm, unscrews the silencer, holsters the gun. Salvano
appears at the top of the stairs. Two busboys are behind
him. One of them is the young pimp. The busboys hurry        *
down, the pimp -- scared shitless but playing it macho-cool. *
Salvano comes down the stairs. Chi Chi stands over his work.
                             SALVANO
                      (to busboys)
Clean up this mess.
                            CHI CHI                                  *
              Who knows who else is talking --                       *

                            SALVANO                                  *
              He was a young fool.                                   *
76   BACK IN UPSTAIRS DINING ROOM
     Salvano and Chi Chi emerge from the basement steps and
walk toward their booth.

                            CHI CHI
              We're crazy waiting for this
bullshit 'shipment.' Let me waste
the other fucker now.

Salvano puts a hand on Chi Chi's shoulder.
                            SALVANO
              Be patient. This will be done
the way it was planned.

77   EXT. BODY AND FENDER SHOP - NIGHT
     Rusting cyclone fences surround   a mud-lot repair yard in a
dingy industrial section. Young    Lation and black workers
finish up for the night; through   the dirty, security-barred
office window we can see Chi Chi   talking on the phone. The
lawyer, Abandano, is also there.

78   EXT. ALLEY - REAR OF SHOP - NIGHT

Nico finishes connecting a small transmitter which has
been hastily wired to the entering phone line.

79   INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Nico and Jackson in the shadows down the street from the
body shop. Nico wears earphones, a small tape recorder
on the seat beside him. Jackson does not look happy.

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                          25.

doing time.

                             NICO
               Lighten up, Jax. No one's
bringing this into court.

                             JACKSON
               Except against us.
                             NICO
               I don't give a shit how we do it.
I just wanna get there.
Jackson gives Nico a dirty look, but stifles her protest.

                             JACKSON
               I thought you said you were
gonna protect me. Cover my butt.
Be my guardian angel --
Nico hears something through the earphones.    Gestures for
silence --
80   ANGLE THROUGH OFFICE WINDOW
     Chi Chi listens with increased intensity to something on the
phone. He starts writing it down --
81   BACK TO NICO
     In unmarked car.   He's writing it down too.
                             NICO

82   EXT. BODY SHOP - NIGHT

Chi Chi emerges from the office, tucking a scrap
of paper into his pocket. Abandano follows. They get
into a late-model Lincoln which pulls out onto the street.     *

85   SERIES OF SHOTS
     As Nico and Jackson tail the Lincoln out of the industrial
zone into a fancier, non-Latin neighborhood. On the sidewalks
we glimpse theatergoers, fashionable white couples out on the
town.
86   LINCOLN

Pulls up to a valet park outside a ton-y restaurant.    A
sign says: "BOGOTA."                                           *

               Jackpot.

88   EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
     Chi Chi and Abandano get out of their car, a valet takes it,
Chi Chi enters the restaurant.

89   INT. SALVANO'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
     Nico and Jackson enter the main dining room, which we
recognize from the scene with Nardo the busboy.



The place is packed with fashionable people of all races.
A band plays salsa; couples dance. Nico and Jackson pass
easily as a hip "uptown" couple. A pretty Latin HOSTESS
approaches them.

                             HOSTESS
               Two for dinner?

                             NICO
               Two for drinks.
They elbow up to the packed bar, standing.   Nico squints
toward the rear dining room.

90   NICO'S POV - DOWN BAR
     Looking past numerous patrons, we see Chi Chi whisper
something to a waiter and take a seat at a rear table
(the same "owner's table" where Salvano sat before.)
The waiter hurries off into a back hallway.
91   NICO AND JACKSON - AT BAR
     Jackson moves to the salsa beat.   A BARMAID approaches.
                             JACKSON
               Gimme something stiff.   I need it.
                              BARMAID
               Who doesn't?

Nico's eyes never leave Chi Chi.
92   REAR DINING ROOM
     From the back hallway Salvano emerges -- in his tux,
looking prosperous. He sits down beside Chi Chi and
Abandano. A waitress brings two drinks. After a few
words, Chi Chi removes the scrap of paper from his pocket,
hands it to Salvano.
                             NICO (O.S.)
               You'll have your engine block
next Tuesday, boss.
93   BACK TO NICO AND JACKSON

As the Barmaid brings their drinks. Jackson sees her
peaceful week to retirement flying out the window.
                             JACKSON
               Why couldn't it be a week from
Tuesday? I could read about it
in the paper.
Nico grabs her waist, pulls her onto the dance floor, and
does a playful twirl.

95    NICO, JACKSON AND LUKICH

The two men, dressed as meat processors in hard hats and
bloody white coats, rake cattle guts under the eave of a
packing plant. Jackson, dressed like a USDA Inspector and    *
carrying a clipboard, inspects a few hanging carcasses.

                              JACKSON
                You missed a few spots, boys.

                I'm takin' it home t'a make
kilbasa, boss.

Luke casts an impatient glance across the street to a lot
with four parked meat trucks. We glimpse two "truckers"
keeping low in the shadows of one cab. Down the block a
seemingly empty pickup truck is parked in an alley.

                              LUKICH

We realize Nico, Jackson and Lukich are wired, with mikes
out of sight under their coats. Nico glances to the pick-
up, near to which three men can be spotted in the alley.
Apparently one of them is the walkie-talkie voice.

98   NICO, LUKICH AND JACKSON
     Bored, pissed off, tired.   Suddenly:

99   BATTERED VAN WITH TWO MEN

emerges from a corner, two blocks down.    It starts slowly
this way.

                             1ST WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.)
               All right. Everyone get their
heads outa their ass.

The meat truck men duck down out of sight, the pickup men
back into the shadows. Nico and Lukich keep raking cow
guts. The van passes slowly, checking out the area.
                             JACKSON
                      (sarcastic)
'... And so I quit the police

The van accelerates slightly, turns a corner, vanishes.
Silence.

The van returns.   On a cross street.   Heading behind the
packing plant.

You're too ugly.

Now a second car appears. The Lincoln. Behind it is an
ancient station wagon. Both vehicles take a different
cross street, but both heading behind the packing plant.

                             NICO

You stay put.                                       *

As soon as the two vehicles pass out of sight, Nico and
Lukich ditch their rakes, dart into the packing plant.
The meat truck men START their TRUCK.



The pickup men board their vehicle -- Jackson follows Nico
and Luke -- but at a safe distance.

100   INT. PACKING PLANT - DAY

Nico and Lukich sprint in a crouch past the blood runoffs,
meat cutting tables --

101   NICO'S POV - RUNNING

THROUGH the windows at the rear of the plant, we see the
station wagon and the van, pulling up swiftly beside one
another, men getting out --

102   INT. PLANT
      Nico and Lukich draw their guns, running full-tilt.

103   EXT. REAR OF PACKING PLANT - DAY
      The station wagon men heave their rear door open, the
van men start to open their side door. The Lincoln is
stopped at a distance. Suddenly --
104   NICO AND LUKICH
      burst from the rear door of the packing plant, guns drawn.

106   COPS IN MEAT TRUCK AND PICKUP
      come highballing around both sides of the packing plant --

107   VAN AND STATION WAGON MEN
      OPEN FIRE. There is confusion and mayhem; it's not clear
who's a cop and who's a criminal.

108   NICO AND LUKICH
      dive for cover, RETURNING FIRE. The DEA men in one truck
also OPEN UP. One of the van men is hit between the eyes.
MACHINE GUN FIRE rakes the DEA truck; it spins out of
control; flips. Lukich SHOOTS the machine-gunner.
                                  LUKICH
                           (shouts; points)
Nico!   The Lincoln!



109   LINCOLN
      starts to PEEL OUT. We glimpse Chi Chi in the driver's
seat, Salvano on the passenger side.

110   NICO
      steps in front of the accelerating Lincoln, raises his .45.

111   INT. LINCOLN - DAY
      Salvano and Chi Chi dive below the dash and continue
forward. Salvano, in the passenger seat, raises his GUN;
FIRES blindly -- trying to hit Nico.
112   EXT. LINCOLN - DAY

Nico UNLOADS his .45 into the windshield and the firewall.
The Lincoln keeps coming down the narrow alley.
113   NICO
      brazenly steps up onto the hood and dives, grabbing onto
the roof.
114   INT. LINCOLN - DAY
      Salvano can't believe it. He screams something in
Spanish. He FIRES again, this time through the roof.
115   EXT. LINCOLN - ROOF - DAY
      Bullet holes appear.    Nico narrowly misses being hit.
116   ANOTHER ANGLE - LINCOLN

Nico reaches over the side of the car and SMASHES the pas-
senger WINDOW with his fist.

117   CLOSEUP - NICO'S HAND
      Salvano's face is bashed.     Nico's huge hand grabs Salvano's
throat; he won't let go.

118   CLOSEUP - NICO
      He hangs on with one hand.

119   CLOSEUP - SALVANO
      Nico's fingers now    dig into Salvano's larynx; he may never
talk again. He's     gagging. Salvano now points the gun at
Chi Chi. Chi Chi     makes the decision to stop the car in
order to save his    boss.

      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                            32.

120   NICO
      leaps off the roof pulling Salvano past the broken glass,
out of the window.

121   SEVERAL POLICE VEHICLES                                        *
      SCREECH into the lot. Officers pour out, guns drawn,
surrounding the Lincoln and the other vehicles. Jackson
joins them, weapon in hand.
122   NICO

drags Salvano by the neck across the lot to the van,
slamming the drug dealer up against the van's side.
Lukich, Jackson and Strozah are there, with the DEA cops,      *
all covering the other men.

                               NICO
                        (to Salvano)
How many kilos you got in there,
Skivuzo?
Salvano couldn't answer if he wanted to. The other cops
look at Nico with awe. Lukich whips the van door open,
yanks a tarp off the cargo.
123   INT. VAN
      The engine block sits in a wooden shipping frame, wrapped
with industrial plastic. Nico climbs into the van, rips
the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the
shipping frame, tears them off. In the background,
ambulances are arriving to care for the wounded cops
and criminals.

124   CLOSEUP - ENGINE BLOCK
      From the cylinder heads emerges a full load, not of drugs,
but of plastique tubes labeled U.S. ARMY C-4 HIGH EXPLOSIVE.
125   LUKICH, JACKSON AND OTHER COPS

react with surprise and shock.
126   NICO

rips open one of tubes and smells it.

127   CLOSE - NICO
      Confused; frustrated.

                               NICO
                 What kinda fuckin' high is this?

128   INT. FBI OFFICE - NIGHT
      OPENING ON SALVANO, in a chair, looking bruised and swollen,
and wearing an expression of fuming indignation.

                              SALVANO
                -- I'll tell you what this cop is.
He's a fucking menace!

129   TWO FBI AGENTS (NEELEY AND HALLORAN)                           *
      face Salvano, Chi Chi and the lawyer Abandano (apparently
representing Salvano and Chi Chi). Neeley is on the phone.     *
Pictures of Reagan and Meese are prominent on the wall.
                              SALVANO
                You see what he did to me?!

                              AGENT HALLORAN
                Your problem is being handled right
now, Mr. Salv --
                              SALVANO
                Yeah? Well, it shoulda been
handled twelve hours ago. I don't
know who's running this outfit, but
somebody better get his goddamn wires
straight!
                              AGENT NEELEY                           *

-- yes, sir... yes, sir, I understand --
                              SALVANO
                That maniac should be wearing a
number, not a badge.
Salvano knows what the call is about. He straightens the
tie beneath his bruised neck, assuming the attitude of a
respectable citizen who has been unjustly wronged.
                              AGENT NEELEY                           *
                       (into phone)

You'll have our full cooperation.
Neeley hangs up. Glances dubiously to Halloran. Then turns     *
grimly to Salvano, Chi Chi and the lawyer Abandano.

132   INT. PRECINCT CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - MORNING
      OPENING ON Agent Neeley's face. Composed, clean-cut, but      *
intense, wearing a light-colored business suit. PAN TO
Agent Halloran -- the same upright, clean-shaven bureau look.
The two men are seated to one side of LIEUTENANT FRED STROZAH.
133   NICO, JACKSON, LUKICH AND DEA AND ATF MEN

sit and stand in various postures in front of the Lieutenant's
desk.
                              LIEUTENANT STROZAH
                       (to Nico, DEA 
-- This is no reflection on the
work you officers have done. I
feel, and the whole department
feels, extremely proud of your
initiative and gallantry.
That "spare me the horseshit" look on Nico's face. He's
fuming. Strozah sees Nico's bitter expression. It's on
the others' faces too.
                                LIEUTENANT STROZAH
                As all of you   are well aware,
possession of   these explosives
is a federal   offense and under
jurisdiction   of the F.B.I.
Nico's eyes meet Lieutenant Strozah's. There's respect
between the two, but it's plainly under a helluva strain.
                              NICO
                Sir. With all respect to our
brothers in the Bureau --
(biting sarcasm;
turns to Neeley)                            *
-- That's no answer. It's no
answer to why one of the biggest
dealers in the city is out on the
street now, free as a bird!

Agent Neeley stiffens.                                        *
                              LIEUTENANT STROZAH
                Keep it in your pants, Nico.
These men have a job to do, just
like us.
Nico stifles his outrage. The other cops exchange glances
-- upset and angry. Agent Neeley clears his throat.          *

                              AGENT NEELEY                          *
                Lieutenant, I think these officers

                They've risked their lives. I
understand one man is in the
hospital.

He speaks to the officers.
                              AGENT NEELEY                            *
                What I'm about to say doesn't
leave this room. Is that clear?
Assent from everyone.

                Mr. Salvano has been working for
some time in cooperation with
certain federal agencies.

134   CLOSE - NICO'S FACE
      Stunned and furious at this royal fuck-up.
                              AGENT NEELEY (O.S.)                     *
                I'm not at liberty to divulge
the nature of Mr. Salvano's
involvement -- I just learned of
its existence myself a few hours
ago. But one thing I can tell you --
135   BACK TO AGENT NEELEY                                            *

                              AGENT NEELEY                            *
                Mr. Salvano's role is crucial to
an extremely sensitive ongoing
investigation. Any further
surveillance, harassment, or
unauthorized operations against
this individual are forbidden.
I must order you gentlemen --
(looking straight at
Nico)
-- with all respect for your work
and your courage, to stand down.

Lukich shakes his head; Nico is devastated.     Jackson takes
it all in.

                                                   CUT TO:

136   INT. POLICE SQUAD ROOM - MORNING
      OPENING CLOSE ON a desk drawer being opened. Aside from
rounds of ammo, notes and an aging eggplant parmigiana
sandwich, there are half a dozen hand-labeled audio-
cassettes and a small collection of miniaturized bugging
devices. Jackson and Lukich watch Nico take out the
notes, hand them to Lieutenant Strozah.



                       LIEUTENANT STROZAH
         The tapes too.

                       NICO
                (mocking)
That's my Lawrence Welk
collection!

                       LIEUTENANT STROZAH
         I want everything you got on this
one.
Reluctantly, Nico hands over the tapes.   The Lieutenant eyes
the bugs and wires.
                       LIEUTENANT STROZAH
         I know you don't give a shit
about yourself, Toscani.
(a glance to Jax)
But you're gonna put Jackson's
ass in a sling, too, with these
illegal wires.

136A   OTHER SIDE OF SQUAD ROOM
       Agent Halloran edges up to Jackson, who's grabbing coffee
on the far side of the squad room, and watching from there
as Nico gives Strozah more of a hard time.
                              AGENT HALLORAN
                What's the story on your partner,
Jackson? Did he learn this style
or was he born with a brick up his
ass?
Jackson checks Halloran out. He's black too and, despite
herself, there's a certain rapport.
                              JACKSON
                He has ethics. Unlike certain
others on this case.

Halloran watches the illegal bugs and tapes come out of
Nico's drawer.
                              AGENT HALLORAN
                His 'ethics' are gonna cost him
his badge and his gun.

This "white" talk gives Jackson a pain.   She slips into
her jive mode.
                              JACKSON
                You don't wanna catch him without
no gun.
Halloran's look asks why not?
                              JACKSON
                'Cause what he do with his hands...
make bullet holes look pretty.

Across the room, Nico turns over the tapes.
                              AGENT HALLORAN
                He bad?

                              JACKSON
                Bad bad.

137   INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - STAIRWAY - DAY
      Nico and Jackson come down the stairs. Jackson has had
ample excitement for her last week on the force.

                              JACKSON
                Is that enough? Can we do
something normal now -- like
eat lunch?

                              NICO
                Anything you say, Jax.   How
about Salvano's?

                              JACKSON
                Let it be, Nico.

138   EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DAY

Nico and Jackson's car pulls out into traffic.
139   INT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED (ALLEY BEHIND SALVANO'S)
      Jackson and Nico are eating some fast good.   Nico reaches
to his jacket pocket; takes out a cassette.

                              JACKSON
                What... you kept his tape, too?
Nico already has it in the PLAYER. We hear FRAGMENTS
of the telephone tap from the body shop in Spanish and
English. Jackson looks frustrated. Nico listens care-
fully to what appears to be the taped PHONE CONVERSATION.
                              NICO
                Poetry, ain't it?
140   EXT. REAR SALVANO'S RESTAURANT - DAY (POV FROM CAR)

The pimp (busboy) comes out and dumps a load of garbage.
141   INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

Nico and Jackson case the restaurant from down the alley.
142   EXT. REAR SALVANO'S - NICO'S POV - DAY

From the restaurant door, Salvano and Chi Chi emerge.
They get into a black Cadillac and pull out.                 *
                              NICO (O.S.)
                And now for some dessert.

143   SERIES OF SHOTS

144    EXT. OAK STREET
       Salvano comes out of a fancy flower shop with a bimbo on
his arm. He kisses her goodbye and puts her in a cab.

                               NICO (O.S.)
                 And that must be Mrs. Sal. So nice
to see married couples still in love.

144A   NICO AND JACKSON
       are hidden, waiting.

144B   CHI CHI
       emerges from a dry cleaner's with a suit on a hanger.         *

145    EXT. ST. ELIZABETH'S PARISH CHURCH - DAY

Salvano's Caddy   pulls up outside the same church where we   *
saw Nico's son   get baptized. Salvano and Chi Chi get out,
look both ways   up and down the street. Salvano, holding     *
flowers, makes   eye contact with a car down the block.       *
146    EXT. STREET UP BLOCK FROM CHURCH - DAY

Nico's car backs out of sight around the corner.
147    SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF CHURCH
       Salvano and Chi Chi, seeing nothing, enter the church.
148    INT. CHURCH - DAY
       A smattering of older women and men praying. Salvano and
Chi Chi stop at the head of the aisle, genuflect to the
altar, move in, take seats toward the front.
149    BACK OF CHURCH

Nico and Jackson slip in the front door, glide silently
into the shadows at the rear of the church.

                               JACKSON
                 This is your mother's church,
isn't it?

                               NICO
                 Yeah. But I bet she's never seen
these boys in the choir.
150    NICO'S POV

Salvano's head is bowed, but Chi Chi is looking around
quite carefully. Nico and Jackson fade into the shadows
behind the huge pillars.

151   SALVANO AND CHI CHI
      After a few moments, the pair rises. They cross them-
selves, start out for the front door. As they walk, they
continue to look for something.
152   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                           *

Nico and Jackson emerge into a courtyard which reveals a
day care center and a rectory. They head toward the front
of the building. Jackson, planning on picking up their
tail on Salvano, is stoped by Nico. He wants to stay and
look around.



                             FATHER GENARRO (O.S.)
               Nicola! That can't be you in
church without the family!

Nico turns to see Father Genarro, perspiring in a baggy
sweatshirt, a handball glove on his hand. The courtyard
alongside the church is marked off as an athletic area.

                             NICO
               Father Genarro.
The priest seizes Nico's hand warmly, smiles at Jackson.

                             FATHER GENARRO
               This must be your partner in
crime.
(shakes her hand)
I'm Father Genarro. I saw you at
the baptismal party.
(with a wink to Nico)
What a partner.
                             JACKSON
               Dolores Jackson
(smiling, but
impatient)
Nico, we gotta go --
                             FATHER GENARRO
               No, please --
(more serious now)
It's good you stopped by. I have
to show you something. Please.
The priest begins leading Nico and Jackson. Jackson keeps
glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly
driving by.
153   INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY

This is an old building. The dark corridors resemble an
underground bunker. Old trophies and furniture are stored
along the walls. The two cops and the priest walk.
Another priest emerges from a door, nods, passes. Nico
and Jackson glance in through the door as they walk.
They reach a door with a broken handle. It looks like a
break-in has taken place.

                             FATHER GENARRO
               The rats are getting bigger.
                             NICO
               When did this happen?

                             FATHER GENARRO
               Two nights ago. I didn't call
the police.

      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                        39.         *

Father Genarro knocks on the door, pauses, then knocks
again. The door opens. A twelve-year-old who looks like
he's from Central America stands in the doorway.

                              FATHER GENARRO
                       (in Spanish)
It's all right, son. These are
friends.

The boy steps back and we MOVE INTO --
154   INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY

A largish room, no exposed windows, everything boarded up.
Newly-constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner,
various cots. A number of LATIN REFUGEES -- families mostly
-- react shyly as Father Genarro introduces Nico and Jackson.
Sister Bonifacia is there, and a youthful priest, FATHER
TOMASSINO. We will see both of them again.
                              FATHER GENARRO
                       (referring to the cops)
These are friends.
(to Nico)
This is Father Tomassino.

                             FATHER TOMASSINO
               How do you do?
Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment
between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what
he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father
Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave.
155   NICO, JACKSON AND FATHER GENARRO

continue down the hall.
                             JACKSON
               I didn't know this church was a
sanctuary, Father.
                            FATHER GENARRO
               Yes. But, perhaps not such a
safe one.
                             NICO
               How long have they been here?

                             FATHER GENARRO
               Too long. At least the kids can
go to our school.

                             NICO
               Who did it, Father?



                       FATHER GENARRO
         Kids, maybe.
(significantly)
Maybe worse. It's not the first
time.
                       JACKSON
         We can have a car check by, every
hour.

                         FATHER GENARRO
         No... please.    Police frighten
these people.

156   INT. CHURCH - MAIN AISLE - DAY                              *
      The three are outside, taking their leave. A big smile
and a hand on Father Genarro's shoulder. The priest is
greatly relieved.
                             NICO
               Really, I don't mind coming by.

                             FATHER GENARRO
               Tell me, Nico... When was your
last confession?

                             NICO
               I'm a married man, Father.   I've
got no sins to confess.

                             FATHER GENARRO
               You're a police officer, you have
many sins to confess.
                             JACKSON
               Amen.
Nico and Jackson start off.

                              FATHER GENARRO
                       (calls after Nico)
You come back Sunday. I feel
better when I see Nicola in
church.
(calls louder)
You don't show, I'm phoning your
mother!
                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


HIGH ANGLE FROM ACROSS the street: neighborhood people
dressed in their Sunday best fill the sidewalk, filing in
for Mass. We hear an ORGAN from inside the church.

158   VARIOUS ANGLES - CONGREGATION
      An Italian neighborhood becoming more Hispanic. As the
churchgoers file in, we see families -- women, kids,
babies.

159   NICO, SARA, ROSA AND JULIAN                                 *
      are among the crowd, exchanging pleasantries with friends
and neighbors -- in English, Italian and Spanish.

160   INT. CHURCH - SIDE AISLE
      Sara, holding Julian, slips into a pew. As Nico and Rosa    *
follow, Father Genarro passes, heading for the front.

      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                             41.

                               ROSA
                 Father Genarro! I have you to thank
for getting my son back into church!

                               FATHER GENARRO
                 It's amazing what shame can
accomplish.

Father Genarro smiles and continues on toward the pulpit.

                                          QUICK DISSOLVE TO:


      A)   THE CHOIR
           building to the finish of a hymn.

      B)   NICO'S WIFE (SARA)                                        *
           also singing, balancing baby Julian and a hymnbook.
      C)   NICO AND HIS MOTHER ROSA
           sing with full gusto.

      D)   THE CHOIR MASTER
           makes the sign to be seated.
      E)   CONGREGATION
           sits. We notice a   young, intellectual-looking man
(Alan Singletary)  wearing wire-rim glasses, sitting in
the front row. We   will see his face again later. He
looks out of place  and glances around, surprised as...
      F)   FATHER GENARRO

moves into the pulpit, opens his Bible.
                               FATHER GENARRO
                 In nomine patris, filius et
spiritu sancti... (etc)
162   SARA AND JULIAN                                                *

The little one starts to CRY; she comforts him. Nico
reaches over to try to help. The BABY continues FUSSING.
Nico looks toward the priest and the front of the church.
He notices a woman in a black shawl rise from the front
of the church and turn, heading down one of the side
aisles.

                               SARA                                  *
                        (examines Julian's
diaper)
Way to go, Julian -- perfect timing.

      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           42.

She cynically smiles at Nico. Nico sees the woman in
black pass toward the exit of the church.

163   CLOSEUP - WOMAN

It is the same woman Nico and Jackson were following with
Abandano, the lawyer!

164   CLOSEUP - LARGE SHOPPING BAG

The woman has left it in front of the votive candles
directly before the priest's pulpit.

165   CLOSEUP - NICO
      His head spins from the shopping bag to the doorway --

166   NICO'S POV - DOORWAY

The woman is hastily sneaking out.
167   BACK TO NICO
      Instantly he pushes his family to the floor, covering
them with his body.

168   CLOSEUP - NICO - SECOND LATER
      BOOM!!!    A POWERFUL EXPLOSION erupts between the priest
and his   congregation. Fragments of plaster, wood, and
marble   come blasting past Nico and his family! Churchgoers
in the   first rows are blown off their feet by the shock
wave of   the blast. Pews overturn, smoke everywhere --
169   CHOIR

is shrieking hysterically. Stone and plaster dust rain
down on them from the ceiling.

170   CONGREGATION
      is in total pandemonium.   Screams, cries, panic --

171   PULPIT
      has been blown to oblivion. Where Father Genarro had
been standing is now nothing but smoke and rubble.

172   NICO
      Prone, covering Sara and the baby, groping frantically         *
to protect his mother as well.

                               SARA                                  *
                        (clutching baby)
We're okay! We're okay!

Nico checks them and his mother swiftly.

      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           43.

                              ROSA
                       (in Italian)
Help the others! Help them, Nico!

                                                 CUT TO:


Splattered with real blood.

                                                 CUT BACK TO:


Everyone is down, reeling from the concussion, dust and
smoke. Nico rises alone from this scene.

                              NICO
                       (forcefully)
Help each other move outside.   Be
calm.
175   EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - MORNING
      From a doorway and a shattered window smoke pours forth.
We hear SCREAMS from inside.
176   INT. CHURCH
      Nico on his feet, plainly the leader in this moment of
terror. Worshippers, shattered and bleeding, pour past
him toward the door. Nico grabs a stout-looking church-
goer.
                              NICO
                Call 911. Tell 'em to send
everything they got!
(turns to his wife)
Sara, get the baby and Mama                        *
outside.
Nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst.

177   EXT. FRONT OF CHURCH - MORNING
      The congregation streams out in terror-stricken disarray.
We see Nico's family -- they're all right.

178   NICO
      appears from the church, carrying a young choir girl. He
hands the child over to two older women, races back into
the church.

179   LONG SHOT - STREET OUTSIDE CHURCH
      The first paramedic van comes speeding around the corner,
SIREN BLARING. Police cars appear right behind --

      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                            44.

180   INT. CHURCH
      Nico appears through the backlit smoke and kneels over
the bloodied body of Father Genarro. He desperately tries
to maintain the priest's life.
                                                    CUT TO:

181   INT. HOSPITAL/ICU WARD - AFTERNOON

The aftermath of the blast. Doctors and nurses have the
scene more of less under control, but there's still plenty
of pain and misery.

182   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON
      Nico stands, his back to the wall -- a scary, blank look
on his face. A doctor and several nurses are pulling the
plugs on the terribly mutilated body of Father Genarro.
A nun is crying; a fellow priest is blessing the Father.
183   JACKSON
      arrives.   Nico talks to her, aside.
                               NICO
                 I want a list of everyone that's
been treated here today. Everyone.
                                JACKSON
                 Right.
                               NICO
                 Then find those sanctuary people,
the ones we saw in the church
basement --
As Jackson makes notes.

                               NICO
                 Find out where they're from, why
anyone would want to harm them.

Jackson flips her notepad shut, ready to go.
                               JACKSON
                 Where are you gonna be?

                               NICO
                 Just stay near a radio.   I'll find
you.

184   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NICO'S MOTHER (ROSA) - AFTERNOON

Sits on a bench with a bandage over one eye. Sara             *
and Julian are sleeping beside her. Nico kneels beside
his mother, deeply concerned. Nico takes his mother's
arm, helps her to her feet.

      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        45.

Sara wakes and picks up Julian. Mama knows Father Genarro     *
has died. She begins sobbing softly. Other members of
the congregation are in the hallway, mourning. Nico, with
his family, takes several steps toward the exit. Suddenly,
Nico stops. He sees Agent Neeley entering (the FBI man who    *
ordered him off the case) accompanied by Lieutenant Strozah   *
and two uniformed officers.

                              NICO
                Sara... go down to the car; I'll                    *
be with you in a minute.
He hails Neeley.                                              *

                              NICO
                I need to talk to you.
(a glance to Strozah
and others)
... Alone.
Neeley nods. Nico leads him off the corridor, through a       *
fire exit door --
185   STAIRWELL LANDING
      The door closes behind them. Nico and the FBI man are
alone on the stairway landing.
                              AGENT NEELEY                          *
                       (impatient)
What the hell is it, Toscani?
Without warning, Nico grabs Neeley by both lapels, slams      *
him furiously into the wall!
                               NICO
                You.   That's what the hell it is!
                              AGENT NEELEY                          *
                Get your goddam hands off me!
Neeley tries to shake free; Nico won't let him.               *

                              NICO
                You let Salvano walk.
                              AGENT NEELEY                          *
                Salvano?! Are you crazy?
(rips himself free)
What does he have to do with this?
                              NICO
                That was no cherry bomb in there.
That was C-fucking-4!
(struggles to master
his rage)
I've used that shit.
                              (MORE)



                       NICO (CONT'D)
         I know what it smells like, I know
what it blows like --

Neeley glares at Nico.                                    *
                       AGENT NEELEY                       *
         Salvano never came near that C-4.
It's in federal holding now!
Besides, why would he blow up a
church?
                       NICO
         I tailed Salvano. Two days ago.
Him and one of his apes were in
that church -- and they weren't
taking communion. I saw some broad
saw who was with his lawyer plant
the bomb. Now I want some goddamn
answers.
                       AGENT NEELEY                       *
         You tailed him? After I ordered
you off?
                         NICO
         Where is he?    Where's Salvano?
                       AGENT NEELEY                       *
         My orders were release him.    Not
babysit him.
Neeley brushes Nico's fingermarks off his lapels.         *
                       AGENT NEELEY                       *
         You think you're rough stuff,
Toscani -- martial arts hero, chop
suey crap. Well I'll tell you
something: you're not bullet-
proof. You're not even a good
cop.
(composes himself;
reclaims his dignity)
You sneak around, playing your
street dick games. But all you
come up with is conjecture, wild
coincidence and bullshit.

                       NICO
         I want the agent who signed for
the explosives.

                       AGENT NEELEY                       *
         I'll do my job. You do yours.
                       NICO
         Bank on it, pal.

      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                           47.

Nico stalks off.   The door slams.
                                                  CUT TO:

186   MONTAGE WITH SCORE


Nico's unmarked car whips in front.   Nico storms toward
the front door of the restaurant.
      B)   INT. RESTAURANT - LATE AFTERNOON                           *

Nico storms through toward the restaurant rear. The
employees are getting ready for the evening crowd. He
flashes his badge, checks the kitchen, Salvano's
office.   The man is gone.

      C)   INT. MORGUE - LATE AFTERNOON
           Jackson has her list from the hospital.    A coroner and
his assitant show her a body on a slab.    The body is
that of Alan Singletary, the man we saw   in the front     *
row of the church. Jackson takes notes.     The dead man   *
is definitely not the ethnic type you'd   expect in St.
Mary's congregation.
      D)   EXT. BODY AND FENDER SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON
           The same place where Nico and Jackson wire-tapped Chi
Chi. Nico interrogates the shop boss, several workers.
All shake their head, gesture emphatically. Salvano
not here.
      E)   CUT BACK TO MORGUE - JACKSON

takes Polaroids of the dead man's I.D. and personal
effects.

187   CLOSEUP OF DEAD MAN'S EFFECTS
      as Jackson's flash pops. We see clearly a U.S. Senate
staff ID, a U.S. Senate office building parking pass and
an Illinois driver's license with address.
188   EXT. AFFLUENT BROWNSTONE - LATE AFTERNOON

Nico comes storming out. A Maid and a bodyguard follow
after him screaming. The door slams. We see it is
missing a panel.
                              MAID
                You gonna be in real trouble,
mister, when El Senor Salvano
find out about dis.

      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                            48.

189   EXT. ST. ELIZABETH'S CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON
      Jackson at the blast scene. Police tapes rope the area
off while a TV news crew photographs the damage. Jackson       *
talks with neighborhood people, asking questions.
190   EXT. BICEK'S BAR - LATE AFTERNOON

Nico in the alley, grilling several tough guys we saw be-
fore when he raided this bar. The answers are all zero;
Nico's disgusted, worn out, frustrated. He starts out
the alley -- At the edge of the street, a battered van pulls
in. A jacketed LATINO MAN leans against it, an unlit ciga-
rette in his mouth. As Nico approaches, turning toward
his car --
                                 FIRST LATINO
                          (polite, casual)
'Cuse me, sir. Can I bum a light?
Nico slows, eyeing the   guy dubiously. As he reaches to
his jacket -- The side   door of the van flashes open. A
.38 is leveled straight   at Nico's head. Instantly three
other Latino hoods leap   to the sidewalk.
                                 FIRST LATINO
                          (machete under jacket)
Don't even think about it,
motherfucker.
Machete Man (First Latino) snatches Nico's gun from its
shoulder holster. Two hoods shove Nico back into the
alley. Nico checks out his assailants quickly. Four of
them. Machete, CROWBAR, BALL BAT, GUN.
                                 MACHETE MAN (FIRST LATINO)
                   You come to our streets... fuck
with our people. Now our people
gonna fuck with you.

The five advance on Nico.
                                 PIPE MAN
                   We ain't gonna shoot you, man.
We gonna beat you to death. You
gonna learn what it means to 'get
down.'

191   QUICK CUTS
      A)   Nico is  trapped. The hoods advancing. Nico has a
moment  of stillness, as if all senses are clicking
out of  normal gear and into some hyper-combat readi-
ness.   Then:



B)   Gun and Machete Man are side by side. As Machete Man
starts to move, Nico spins in beside him, seizes his
wrist, twists it violently, wrenching the machete away,
keeping Machete Man between him and Gun Man so Gun
Man can't shoot. In a flash, Nico swings the machete,
slicing over the top of Machete Man, half-severing
the wrist of Gun Man. Gun Man falls, clutching his
wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain
link fence, out of reach. Nico flips Machete Man
(who has Nico's gun in his pocket) sending him crash-
ing, half-unconscious.
C)   Instantly, Pipe Man aims a home run shot at Nico's
head. Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of
the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc,
blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing
Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee. Pipe Man goes
down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in
pain.
D)   Now Ball Bat attacks. Nico intercepts the blow,
flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail-
ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the
van. Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with
just his head and shoulders dangling free.

E)   Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch. Crowbar
Man sees his chance. He is the fiercest of the four,
and the savviest fighter. He throws three consecu-
tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one
knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third,
machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and
whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of
Crowbar Man. Crowbar Man can't believe it. He re-
mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at
his own groin.
F)   Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des-
perately to regain his senses. He tries to get
Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a-
way. Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror,
bolts.

G)   Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to
Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van
window. Nico gives Bat Man one parting punch to the
head, then tears off after Machete Man --

192   EXT. STREET - DAY
      Shrieks from passersby as Machete Man hurtles past,
straight into the street. A car nearly hits him, he
vaults its hood. Here comes Nico, in hot pursuit. He
too leaps the car, whose owner is staring, cursing --
193   ANGLE DOWN BLOCK

An all-out foot face.



Machete Man is a speedster; he hurdles a row of trash cans.
TWO YOUNG GIRLS, on a stoop, whistle as he passes.

                             FIRST GIRL
                Fly, baby!
194   NICO

tears after this human cannonball.   Amazingly, he's
gaining --
195   INT. BODEGA - DAY

Machete Man highballs off the sidewalk, straight into a
Mom and Pop groceria. Customers scatter in shock as the
hood blasts past them, out the back door. Here comes
Nico. Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past --

196   EXT. YARD BEHIND BODEGA - DAY
      Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with
tables and chairs. He leaps the fence into the next yard,
which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles the headstone
inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side --
197   BACK TO NICCO
      pursuing along the same route.
198   MACHETE MAN

claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame-
work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a-
bove the third back yard. Plastic sheeting is tacked
between the beams. Machete Man glances back at Nico,
starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours.
Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto
the two-by-fours. We hear FEMALE SCREAMS from below as
the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously.
Machete Man reaches the far side. A fire escape is ad-
jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by
the ankle. The two crash together back onto the two-by-
fours, which give way, sending them plunging into --

199   BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY
      Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with
terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man
scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner
next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move
either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The
girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright.

                              MACHETE MAN
                       (to Nico, in terror)
No, hermano. Please --



Nico starts menacingly toward the hood, breathing hard
from the chase.

                           NICO
             Who put up the money?
                            MACHETE MAN
             What money?

Nico grabs him by the hair.
                           NICO
             You didn't come after me for a
piece of ass.
(twists the youth's
neck)
Who paid you?

                             MACHETE MAN
             I told ya!    No one!
Nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood
doubles over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even
louder. Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare.
                           NICO
                    (shouting)
Shut up!
The girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back
to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking
the punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see
that Nico can break his elbow with one blow.
                          NICO
                   Give it to me!
Nico raises his fist to strike.

                           MACHETE MAN
             Jimmy Constanza!
Nico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's
wallet from his trouser pocket. Nico rips the wallet a-
part, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up. He
grabs the punk by the hair with his free hand. Machete
Man is staring up in terror, wondering what this means.

                           NICO
             If you're lying to me, I'll come
and kill you right in your own
fucking kitchen.

Nico dumps him on the ground and walks away.    Instantly
Machete Man changes his tune.
                            MACHETE MAN
             Salvano!   Bautista Salvano!

Nico walks back, his foot smashes into the punk's face.
He hits the ground with a thud.

                               NICO
                 Gracias, muchacho.
Nico walks away.

200   MONTAGE WITH SCORE

      A)   INT. NICO'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
           Nico at the kitchen table spread with notepads, old add-
ress books, 3X5 cards. He's on the phone, impatient,
apparently getting nowhere. He slams the phone down.
      B)   INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Nico paces, phone cradled to ear, talking urgently.
CLICK: he's been hung up on; he looks at the receiver
in frustration and disgust.
      C)   CLOSE - CORKBOARD ON KITCHEN WALL
           Nico's hands pushpin a 3X5 card into the wall.

      D)   INSERT - 3X5 CARD
           We read: "FBI / Agent Smith / 11:53 / B.S. / Covering
for who?"

      E)   KITCHEN - NIGHT
           Nico back at the table, listening to the wiretap
tape, transcribing it.

      F)   ANOTHER ANGLE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER)
           Nico holds Julian, goes over notes.

      G)   CLOSE - YELLOW LEGAL PAD
           The page is headed: "FATHER GENARRO." Below in
doodle formation, are a series of boxes, each one
containing a phrase. We read: "Father G had some-
thing on Salvano?" "Church break-in?" "Drug infor-
mation?" "Father G connected to FBI?" Irritably,
Nico's pencil crosses everything out.

201   SARA                                                            *
      Appears in a nightgown at the kitchen doorway.   She looks
frail, frightened. MUSIC ENDS.

                        (softly)
I can't sleep. Will you come and
hold me?

                              NICO
                Of course I will. I've been waiting
to hear from Jax. She was supposed
to get back to me by now.

202   INT. NICO'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
      Nico comes in with his arms around Sara. She stops
near the bed, holds him tight. They look to little
Julian sleeping in the crib nearby.
                              SARA
                Thank God you couldn't find your
shoes. We would of have been
sitting in the front row.
(beat)
Alright, I know the rules -- I
don't ask you don't tell. But
could've died today and I deserve
to know.
(beat)
Why did we go to church this
morning?
                              NICO
                I'm willing to break   the rules;
I'm willing to tell   you whatever
I know. But I need    some time.
Could you just give   me some time?
Nico leans to kiss her, but is cut off by the HARSH RING
of a PHONE. Sara starts at the sound. She and Nico
glance at each other --
                              SARA
                I'll bet that's her.
Nico picks up the phone.

                              NICO
                       (into phone)
This better be good, Jax.

                              MAN (V.O.)
                       (filtered)
It's bad, Nico.

Nico glances to Sara. The voice on the   phone is not
Jackson. Nico is chilled. He glances    to Sara, finger to
his lips. He points to his bare wrist   as if wanting to know
the exact time. Sara, not sure what's   going on, mouths:
"Two-fifteen."

                              NICO
                       (into phone)
Long time, Nelson.

203   EXT. STREET - PHONE BOOTH - LATE NIGHT
      We recognize Fox, Nico's buddy  from SE Asia whom we met
in the opening sequence.  Fox,  too, of course, looks 15
years older. He wears a  suit  and seems quite prosperous.
We are unable to identify from  where Fox calls.
                              FOX
                You should know not to use a name
on an open line.
(beat)
I'm gonna talk for fifteen
seconds, then I'm getting off.
You're in trouble, Nico.
204   BACK TO NICO'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

                              FOX (V.O.)
                       (filtered)
Serious, serious trouble. Take
your wife and family and get them
someplace safe now.
205   BACK TO STREET - PHONE BOOTH - LATE NIGHT

                You hear me? Now. I'm risking my
ass by telling you this. Good
luck, kid.
206   BACK TO NICO'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
      The PHONE CLICKS DEAD. Nico tries to keep a casual ex-
pression. Sara sees through it -- she knows he's shaken.     *
                              SARA                                 *
                       (grim)
That was Fox, wasn't it?

Nico doesn't answer.
                              SARA                                 *
                       (very concerned)
Why is the C.I.A. calling you at
two in the morning?
                              NICO
                It's okay, sweetheart --
(crosses to her, puts
his arms around her)
-- You know what a crazy bastard
Fox is. He gets drunk and forgets
he's halfway around the world. He
calls me.
Nico gives her a squeeze and a smile.

                              NICO
                He just wanted to make sure we got
his Christmas card.

207   INT. BEDROOM - LATER
      Sara is sleeping next to Nico. Julian next to her. A         *
LOUD POUNDING comes O.S. from the front door. Nico jumps
out of bed. His gun appears in his hand, as if from nowhere,
he steps quickly to the front window, looks out --
208   NICO'S POV - STREET BELOW

Two unmarked cars pull in.
209   BACK TO NICO

He moves swiftly to the rear window and spots another un-      *
marked car.                                                    *
210   INT. DOWNSTAIRS - FRONT DOOR
      Nico enters the vestibule in his pajama bottoms with his gun
in his hand.
                              VOICE THROUGH DOOR (O.S.)
                F.B.I., Toscani. Open up.
Nico pulls aside a curtained glass panel; he recognizes
two uniformed police officers, plus Neeley and Halloran,       *
the FBI agents who authorized the release of Salvano. He
lowers his gun, opens the door. The cops surge in.
                               NICO
                        (to one of cops)
It's a little early for breakfast,
O'Hara.
                              O'HARA
                Sorry, Nico.
(displays warrant)
You're under arrest.

                       (reaches for Nico's
gun)
I'll take this, thank you.

Before Neeley can get his hand on the gun, Nico, without       *
pausing, hands it over to another agent.
                              NICO
                No, you won't. I'm gonna give it
to you.

211   INT. NICO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
      JULIAN BAWLS fearfully; Sara holds him, trembling. Nico         *
is hurriedly getting dressed. A cop and the FBI agents
stand at the door.
                              SARA                                    *

This is ridiculous -- there's
no need for this!
                              NICO
                It's all right, darling.

Two agents enter the room carrying Nico's confiscated
papers and tapes and begin rummaging through dressers,
jewelry boxes and closets. Rosa crosses swiftly to calm
Sara.                                                           *

                              ROSA
                       (to cops)
Who do you think you are --
coming in here like this,
treating my son like a criminal?
                              SARA                                    *
                Why are you terrifying us?
There's an infant here!
Nico pulls on a jacket. He looks like he could kill.    He
restrains himself for his family's sake.
                              AGENT HALLORAN
                       (to cops)
Check that coat.

The cops cross to frisk Nico.   Sara, still holding the baby,   *
starts slapping at them.

                              SARA                                    *
                Get your hands off him!
Rosa grabs Sara --                                              *

                              NICO

allowing himself
to be frisked)
It's all a mistake, Sara -- It's                      *
gonna be all right.
The cops steer Nico toward the door.

                              SARA                                    *

Sara grabs for the phone; Nico is manhandled out the            *
door --

212   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

The neighbors are now on their porches.   Nico is led to a
waiting unmarked car.

                                                  CUT TO:

213   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - LATE NIGHT
      Bad Dude, the bartender we remember from Nico's first
visit to the Polish bar, finishes signing a deposition.
A cop takes the paper. Bad Dude stands, glances half-
fearfully, half-defiantly to Nico, who is led down a hall-
way flanked by two uniformed officers. Agent Halloran
opens the door for Bad Dude, who exits.

214   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATE NIGHT
      Neeley, Halloran, Lieutenant Strozah and Deputy Superinten-     *
dent JACK CROWDER. Halloran indicates a stack of                *
depositions, tapes and notes on the table before Nico.

barrel, Toscani. We don't have

Nico comes out of his chair, going for Halloran.      Strozah
tries to block him, but it's useless.

Nico stops. He's speechless with rage.    His finger points
toward Halloran like a loaded gun.

You were ordered to back off on
Salvano. But you had too big a
hard-on for that, didn't you--

Nico contains his fury. He steps away from Strozah, with
a gesture that says "I won't hurt you."

                       (to Strozah)
Fred.   You can't be in on this.
Nico faces his lieutenant -- a look that calls on long       *
years of comradeship and loyalty. Strozah is torn. He's
a good man, over his head in a situation he doesn't com-
pletely understand.
                             LIEUTENANT STROZAH                    *
               You're officially suspended, Toscani.
I want your tin... and your iron.
Neeley leans past Nico; drops Nico's gun (with an evidence   *
tag on it) onto the table. Nico looks to Strozah, who
averts his eyes. Nico flips his badge onto the table.
                             NICO

Jackson and Lukich are waiting by Nico's car.    They see
Nico emerge from the phone booth.

                        JACKSON (CONT'D)
          They're refugees from El Salvador,
Guatemala, Chile. They won't talk                  *
to me, they're terrified of cops.

Jackson has an armload of notes, including photocopies of
news clippings.

                        JACKSON
          Ready for this? One of the people
killed at the church was definitely
not a congregation member.

She shows Nico and Lukich the Polaroids we saw her take in
the morgue.
                        JACKSON
          Alan Singletary. He's an aide to
Senator Harrison.
Nico is electrified.
                        JACKSON
          That's right. Harrison. Foreign
relations committee. The guy who's
been crawling all over the Central
American drug connections.
                        NICO

You're gonna make a helluva D.A.,
Jax.

          God help us.

                        JACKSON
                 (savors the com-
pliment)
I've been at the Tribune all night,
wearing out their Xerox machine.
Harrison's staff has been
compiling some kind of white
paper. He's due to release it
next week.
Nico's mind races.

                        NICO
          That's how Fox knew.
                         JACKSON
          What?

Nico turns to Lukich, dead earnest.

      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           60.

                              NICO
                Luke. I  want you to go to my
house.  Call Branca... my mother
has the number. Get my family
ready to move out.
                              LUKICH
                You got it, buddy.

                              NICO
                Stay with 'em. We'll be there.
                              LUKICH
                What's going on, Nico?   What
happened?
                              NICO
                I got a call last night. An old
agency friend. He told me my
family was in danger.
Jax and Lukich can't put all the pieces together yet.    But
if it's drugs-CIA-Senate, it's got to be heavy.
                              LUKICH
                You got a weapon?
Lukich knows he doesn't. He glances up and down the
street, makes sure no one's watching -- then cracks the
driver's door of his car. There's a bulge in the map
pocket. Nico  pulls out a Sig Saur .45.
                               LUKICH
                Try this on.

217   INT. DAY CARE CENTER (BEHIND CHURCH) - MORNING
      OPENING CLOSE ON the faces of the sanctuary refugees.
They are faces that have known fear and tragedy. The kind
of faces we see on newsreels after villages have been
burned and family members murdered. The refugees have
been moved from church basement to a back room in the day
care center. Nico kneels, facing them. Jackson in the
background. A nun (SISTER BONIFACIA) and a priest (whom
we saw in Genarro's hospital room) watch over the people.
Nico is frustrated; he can't crack the refugees' fear.
                              NICO
                       (to nun)
Sister... you know me. Tell them
there's no need for fear.



                        SISTER BONIFACIA
          There is rubble all over the yard,
Nicola.

(THE REST OF THE SCENE MAY BE IN ENGLISH, OR SPANISH WITH


                 (to refugees)
I was there... in the church.
They tried to kill my family, too.
Several of the refugees look like they want to speak, but
they are terrified.
                        NICO
          I know there was a man here, from
an American senator's office. Who
was he going to speak to?
The refugees become increasingly anxious.
                        NICO
                 (to one woman)
Was it you, senora?
(to a man)
Was it you?
More silence.    Glances among the people.   Finally:
                          REFUGEE WOMAN
          The priest.
The others shrink.   The Woman glances to them.
                          NICO
          Who?
(gently)
Father Genarro?

                        REFUGEE WOMAN
          The other one.

Nico looks to the American priest standing there.
                       REFUGEE WOMAN
          No. The young one. From Costa
Rica.

Sister Bonifacia sighs.
                        SISTER BONIFACIA
          Father Tomassino.

Jackson has her pad out, taking notes. Bonifacia knows
too much has already been revealed; she must speak.



                              SISTER BONIFACIA
                He came alone... two weeks ago.
He had papers. Papers to give to
the senator.

Nico tries to contain his excitement; not scare anyone by
losing his calm.

                              NICO
                But the bomb... The bomb was
planted to destroy the pulpit.
                              SISTER BONIFACIA
                Father Tomassino was going to
give the Mass that day.
(shaken)
Father Genarro talked him out of
it.

The refugees' faces confirm this.
                              NICO
                       (understands)
It was Father Tomassino they were
trying to kill.

Bonifacia starts softly to cry.    Nico puts his hand on her
shoulder, comforting her.
                              NICO
                Where is Tomassino?   Where is he
now?
The nun shakes her head.   Nico looks to the refugees.
They don't know, either.

                              REFUGEE MAN
                He run, mister. He go --

He gestures: "who knows where?"
                              NICO
                If you know where he is, you've
got to tell me. I want to help
him. I can help him.
The refugees lower their eyes. Bonifacia continues her
soft weeping. Nico glances to Jackson; her look says
"Enough, let's leave these poor people alone." Nico
stands, touches Bonifacia one more time on the shoulder --
218   EXT. CHURCH DAY CARE BUILDING - DAY

Nico and Jackson come out.   Nico has made a decision.
                              NICO
                You're outa this, Jax.    Go home.

                          (displays her notes)
You see this list? Well, I'm not
done.

Nico admires his partner's guts, but he's worried.
                              JACKSON
                I'm not a rookie, Toscani. Now,
go home. Get your family out of
here.
Nico agrees.    The pair starts to split.

      Nico drives, a jumble of emotions on his face.      Urgency
fear, exhaustion. He's deep in thought --

220   EXT. INTERSECTION - MORNING
      Nico's car pulls up at a stop light. He looks around
without really seeing. An old lady pulls a shopping cart       *
while a crossing guard takes some kids across the street.      *
221   ANOTHER CAR
      ROARS up out of nowhere, without two men inside, SCREECH-
ING to a stop head-on to Nico's door. Its doors spring
open --
222   NICO

dives toward his own passenger door --
223   SECOND CAR - TWO MORE ARMED MEN

leap out, OPEN FIRE with pistols and automatic weapons.
224   QUICK CUTS

Nico's car riddled with a furious FUSILLADE.      WINDOWS
BLOW OUT; the driver's door is shredded --

225   NICO - ON FLOORBOARD
      crawling frantically; shoving the passenger door open as
a FIRESTORM of lead and FLYING GLASS BLAZES all around
him.
226   FOUR MEN

FIRING point blank (6 to ten feet) into Nico's car.   The
men are cool, professional.
227   NICO

spills from the passenger door onto the ground, scrambles
like mad under his own car toward one of the attackers' cars.
228   PEDESTRIANS AROUND INTERSECTION

scream and scatter in terror.
229   FOUR MEN
      FIRING as shells spew from the ejection ports of their
weapons.
230   NICO'S CAR
      being chewed to pieces --
231   NICO - UNDER MEN'S CAR                                          *

crawling at full speed from the car's front to its back.
On the ground, alongside the car, spent CARTRIDGE CASES
RAIN like hailstones.
232   FOUR MEN
      As their magazines empty. The last shells spring free,
GUN BARRELS SIZZLE, blue smoke fills the air. The leader
waves two men forward to check their kill. At that
instant:
233   NICO

springs to his feet behind the men, the Sig Saur .45            *
clutched in both hands. (He has crawled under both cars
to envelop his attackers.)

                                 NICO
                   Over here, you sons-a-bitches!
Nico's rage is superhuman. The men stare in conster-
nation. One of the men has a fresh magazine half into
his weapon --

      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        65.

                              NICO
                       (eyes like an
animal)
Try it. Be my guest.

The man lets the magazine clatter to the street. The
others raise their hands. It takes all Nico's strength
to keep from wasting all four of them on the spot. His
gaze swings wildly around the intersection. He spots a
corner grocery store. A phone inside.
                              NICO
                       (gestures with gun)
Over there! Move it! -- Now!!
The men are scared shitless. They put their hands in
back of their heads; trot jelly-legged --

234   INT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - DAY
      A Pakistani counter clerk takes one look at the mob enter-
ing his store and bolts for the rear. A customer exits
as Nico herds his captives in.
                             NICO
               Hands on the counter!
Three men do it; the fourth is slow.
                             NICO
               Don't tempt me, ASSHOLE --
The fourth obeys. Nico moves to the pay phone on the
wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re-         *
ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes
his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men
sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his
eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again
to the dial -- A free-standing sales display hurtles
toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men
has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a
second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering
into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet.
One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the
freezer doors -- Wham! -- smack into the man's face. The
GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's
three against one -- prime odds for Nico. He wades into
his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails
into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land
a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered
forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker --

235   POV FROM OUTSIDE STORE

It looks like a tornado has hit the interior. Magazine
RACKS CRASH, mayo jars fly through the air, the ICE
MACHINE seems to EXPLODE as a man's back careens into it --

236   STREET CORNER UP BLOCK
      Two police cars heave into view, SIRENS WAILING --

237   FRONT DOORS OF STORE
      Nico takes the last man, lifts him up, and drives him like
a battering ram straight through the glass.

238   NICO
      Wild-eyed and bloody, sees the cop cars whipping into the
corner. He spins to see his .45 on the floor -- too far
away to race for. He bolts down a gangway.

245   INT. NICO'S BEDROOM - DAY

Sara grabs a handful of dresses from the closet and angrily      *
throws them into an open suitcase on the bed. Nico watches,
hoping to ride the storm.

Sara...                                               *

Sara is at the dresser, pulling open drawers, dumping her      *
clothes haphazardly into the suitcase. She stops suddenly.
She pulls out a handgun and ammo from her panty drawer. She
starts to weep. Nico steps up behind her, puts his arms
around her.

                             NICO
               You'll be safe with Uncle Branca.
It's gotta be this way... I'm sorry.

He turns her around to face him.
                             NICO
               Don't you think I'd rather be with
you?
He holds her passionately.    Rosa coughs loudly in the doorway.

Don't forget the baby's sweater --

                             ROSA
               I know about babies.
We glimpse other relatives in the hallway; Nico hands them
a pair of suitcases; they hurry off --

They get their suitcases into the sedan. Mama and the baby

Lukich comes around from the front, glancing around like a
lookout.

                She thinks there may be documents at
some guy's apartment.

Nico starts toward the rear basement door.    Lukich falls
in with him.
247   INT. BASEMENT - DAY
      Nico and Lukich enter, start down the steps.
                              NICO
                They killed the wrong priest.
Lukich doesn't understand.
                              NICO
                There was a second priest... from
Costa Rica... hiding at the church.
He was the one they meant to kill.
Nico starts to remove a large piece of ducting from the
basement heater.
                              LUKICH
                And you know where to find him?
                               NICO
                No.

The hole in the foundation holds several shotguns and a
couple of pistols, some passports and some cash.

                              LUKICH

Nico grabs the pistols, starts to strap them on.

Branca STARTS the SEDAN. Sara looks back, pained.              *
Rosa, Lukich and Julian are also in the car. Nico grabs
another hand-carried case from the basement, hurries into
Lukich's car.

249    NICO'S POV - LOOKING DOWN DRIVEWAY
       Two police cars pull up to the front of the house.

254   INT. FEDERAL WAREHOUSE - DAY
      Nico walks casually beside Agent Neeley, holding his gun out   *
of sight in his pocket. They proceed down a corridor. Be-
hind them we glimpse a security checkpoint, manned by two
uniformed guards, through which they apparently have already
passed.

255   ANGLE - CORRIDOR

The two walk past floor-to-ceiling warehouse shelves, packed
with labeled boxes, film cans, etc. which are visible
through a heavy wire-mesh screen.

256   ADMINISTRATIVE WINDOW
      A pot-bellied, Naval-retired-type CLERK looks up from his
desk as Nico and Neeley come up to the counter. We see a      *
sign: "EVIDENCE HOLDING DEPOT -- You MUST Have Your Requi-
sition Number!!!" The Clerk stands, chomping a cigar, wad-
dles to the counter. We see his arms covered with tattoos.

We'd like to see the paperwork.
The Clerk has an accordion file right under the counter.
He indicates a sign-in book.

                             CLERK
               You gotta sign.

Neeley signs the book. The Clerk starts leafing through his   *
files, searching for the release form.
                             CLERK
               Yeah... I remember that guy. Flew in
special from Langley. Bomb tech.
Real nice fella --

lifts it from
file)

Thank you. That's what I wanted.
Nico takes the mike, clicks it back into its cradle.     Neeley    *
freezes, unsure what Nico's going to do with him.

      C)   EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

Nico parks Neeley's car in a huge packed lot. A towering *
marquee sign reads: "COMPUTER EXPO '87." Nico starts on
foot toward the convention center entrance.

      D)   INT. CONDO APARTMENT - DAY
           Jackson enters, looking guilty as hell. She picks up
a framed photo from a piano: the dead Senator's aide

Jackson sets the photo down, starts rummaging through
