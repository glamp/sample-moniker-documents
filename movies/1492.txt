    INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY

    We start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a
    splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the
    garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate
    hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large
    topaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing
    on marble floors.

                                    CUT TO:

    A Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion,
    dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is
    TREASURER SANCHEZ.

    A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We
    can now here a subdued conversation.

    <span class="person">TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:

    The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.
    A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN
    ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.

    He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large
    table.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and
    three dignitaries of Church and State.

    All sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document
    and starts to read aloud.

    On screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500

                    SANCHEZ
            Your Majesty would wish to know the
            true facts concerning the island of
            Hispanola, our first settlement in
            the New World, and the activities
            there of your servant, Christopher
            Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,
            Governor of that Island.  You will
            remember with what hopes and
            promises he beguiled us -- the truth
            is that he now presides over a state
            of chaos, degradation and madness
            beyond imagining.

    SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.

                    SANCHEZ
            From the beginning, Columbus proved
            himself incapable of managing the
            affairs of the island.  He appointed
            his brothers to important positions,
            at once injuring the pride and
            dignity of the nobles who had gone
            with him.  He promised to build a
            city, the City of Isabel, named
            after Your Majesty.  What he
            actually built was nothing but a
            collection of huts, and that in the
            wrong place, for all of it was
            easily swept away by rain and mud.
            Is that not so, Brother Buyl?

    The PRIEST nods.

                    BROTHER BUYL
            Yes, Your Honor.

                    SANCHEZ
            He promised gold.  Not finding the
            easy quantities he promised,
            Columbus commanded each Indian to
            pay an annual tribute.  Most being
            unable to, they were barbarously
            punished, against the express wish
            of Your Christian Majesties...

    ISABEL lowers her eyes.

                    SANCHEZ
            Since provocation and injustice
            never ceases, many of the Indians
            have fled to the forests, or have
            begun to slay the Christians.

    ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.

                    ISABEL
            Could it be so?<sup>person</sup></span>

                    BROTHER BUYL
            Yes, Your Majesty.

                    SANCHEZ
            But there is worse.  From the
            beginning, he forced the nobles to
            undergo physical labor, treating
            them equally with the Indians, all
            of them reduced to slavery.  When
            the nobleman Adrian de Moxica
            protested against such treatment...
                (he pauses)
            ... he was executed.
                (pause)
            Is that not true also, Brother
            Buyl?

                    BROTHER BUYL
            Yes, Your Honor.  It is all true.
            All of it.  I saw it with my own
            eyes.

                    SANCHEZ
            He has lost control.  His great
            arrogance has led him into
            depravity.  He encourages our
            soldiers to marry the native women.
            He promised a paradise, but he has
            made a hell full of all its horrors.

    Silence.

                    ISABEL
            Is that the man I knew, Treasurer
            Sanchez?

                    SANCHEZ
            Yes, Your Majesty.

                                    CUT TO:

    INT.  HUT - ISLAND - DAY

    CLOSE ON the FACE:  COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed,
    sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious.  Insects
    crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away.
    There is a dripping sound of water.

                    FERNANDO (V.O.)
            Of all the words my Father wrote and
            there were many, I remember these
            the most.  "Nothing that results
            from human progress is achieved with
            unanimous consent..."

    Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a
    table.  COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table.  Some
    of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames.  A
    lizard scuttles into the shadows.

                    FERNANDO (V.O.)
            "And those who are enlightened
            before the others are condemned to
            purse that light in spite of
            others..."

    COLUMBUS stares down at the documents, moving them away
    from the rain drips.  He stares out by the window, and we
    see:

    A devastated landscape.  Flooded roads, half-destroyed
    huts, broken trees... A dog picks its way through the mud.

                    FERNANDO (V.O.)
            There was a time when the New World
            didn't exist...

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

    EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

    A vast stretch of ocean.  It fills the screen.  Unbroken,
    infinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away,
    meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl
    and misty light.

                    FERNANDO (V.O.)
            ... The sun set in the west on an
            ocean where no man had dared to
            venture.  And beyond that,
            infinity...

    Pulling back, we discover:

    A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle
    thirties, are riding a mule.  The MAN'S weather-beaten
    face frames unusually bright eyes.

    On the screen these words:  ANDALUSIA, 1491

    COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at
    the top of the hill.  COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO
    looks up at him in adoration.

                    FERNANDO (V.O.)
            Once I asked my Father where he
            wanted to go.  And he replied:  "I
            want to travel all over the seas.  I
            want to get behind the weather..."

    FERNANDO laughs.  He then starts to hum along with his
    FATHER.

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAY

    A rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone
    walls and thousands of sheep.

    FERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing
    the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him.  High-
    spirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.

    COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching
    his SON'S antics with amusement.  In the distance, the
    solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD.

    COLUMBUS calls out to his son:

                    COLUMBUS
            Fernando!

    FERNANDO runs over.  COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule.

    As they move along the track we now see, perched on a
    distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La
    Rabida, their destination.


    EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

    As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters,
    FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under
    the ROMAN arches.

                    FERNANDO
            Diego!

    He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an
    adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn,
    delicate face.  DIEGO'S response is constrained.

                    COLUMBUS
            Diego!  Aren't you going to kiss
            your brother?

    DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is
    immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS,
    hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.

    The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white-
    haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer.
    MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his
    arms to greet COLUMBUS.  He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns
    to DIEGO.

                    MARCHENA
            Diego, take Fernando to the dining
            hall.  He must be hungry.

                    DIEGO
            Yes, Father.

    Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof.  COLUMBUS and
    MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.

                    MARCHENA
            Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure
            to teach -- but so serious...
            Brothers should be raised together,
            Colon.  Even brothers from different
            mothers...

                    COLUMBUS
            Father, I am doing what I think is
            the best for him.  And he has the
            teacher I would have chosen for
            myself.

    MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.

                    MARCHENA
            Just be careful you don't lose him.

    They have crossed the cloister.  MARCHENA pushes open a
    door.


    INT.  A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY

    Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the
    miracle of printing, a recent German discovery.  Several
    MONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily
    "ILLUMINATING" some of these massive volumes, delicately
    painting around the letters in bright colors and gold
    leaf.

    Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings,
    projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor.  As
    MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is
    punctuated by light and shadow.

                    MARCHENA
                (fumbles in a pocket
                under his robe)
            I have something for you.

    Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.

                    MARCHENA
            You will be heard at the University
            of Salamanca...

    COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.  Almost frantically he
    tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.

                    COLUMBUS
            God... That's in a week!

                    MARCHENA
            That's what it says.

                    COLUMBUS
            How did you manage it?

                    MARCHENA
                (smiling)
            With some difficulty.  I had to
            promise them you were not a total
            fool.

    MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden
    panel.


    INT.  STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY

    MARCHENA is not a tidy man.  Books are piled up on the
    floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps,
    instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an
    inquiring mind.

    With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a
    hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits
    behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.  MARCHENA
    lights a candle and considers the mess.  Then
    methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him
    with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.

    When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his
    expression.  He turns over an hourglass.

                    MARCHENA
            Why do you wish to sail west?

                    COLUMBUS
            To open a new route to Asia.  At the
            moment there are only two ways of
            reaching it...

    He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the
    desk.

                    COLUMBUS
            By sea, sailing around the African
            Continent -- the journey takes a
            year...

    His finger traces the journey, from west to east.

                    COLUMBUS
            Or by land...

    We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger
    tracing a line between Europe and the Far East.

                    COLUMBUS (O.S.)
            ... But the Turks have closed this
            route to all Christians.  Trading
            with the Orient has become arduous,
            if not dangerous.
                (he pauses)
            There is a third way...

    We notice that the outline of the European continent is
    familiar.  But we also notice that, in that great expanse
    of ocean, the whole American continent is missing.

                    COLUMBUS
            By sailing West across the Ocean
            Sea.

    CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.

                    MARCHENA
            How can you be so certain?  The
            Ocean is said to be infinite.

                    COLUMBUS
            Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are
            no more than 750 leagues west of the
            Canary Islands.

                    MARCHENA
            How can you be so certain?

                    COLUMBUS
            The calculations of Toscanelli Marin
            de Tyr, Esdras...

                    MARCHENA
                (interrupting)
            Esdras is a Jew.

                    COLUMBUS
            So was Christ!

    MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration.  He
    glances at the hourglass:

                    MARCHENA
            Two minutes... and already you're a
            dead man.  Don't let passion
            overwhelm you, Colon.

                    COLUMBUS
                (mockingly)
            I'll try to remember that,
            Marchena...

                    MARCHENA
            Father Marchena!

                    COLUMBUS
                (ignoring this)
            Passion is something one cannot
            control!

                    MARCHENA
                (heatedly)
            You get so carried away when you are
            being contradicted!

                    COLUMBUS
            I've been contradicted all my
            life... Eternity!

                    MARCHENA
                (amused)
            Only God knows the meaning of such
            words, my son.


    EXT.  COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING

    DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS
    appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to
    go.

                    COLUMBUS
            Diego.

    COLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes
    meet.  He looks at his SON for a moment.

                    COLUMBUS
            Would you like to come and stay with
            us?

    Uncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an
    answer.

                    COLUMBUS
            I'll do whatever makes you happy.

                    DIEGO
            I am happy, Father.

    COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.

    He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his
    BROTHER as they ride off.


    EXT.  CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT

    COLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO,
    through narrow streets.  There's a clamorous noise in the
    air.  Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with
    excitement, run up the street and brush past them.  Then
    more people.  FERNANDO sits up straight.  The noise grows,
    rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.

    Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside
    the cathedral.  Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS
    tries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens
    in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:  in the
    center of the square stand three pyres, already alit.
    HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.

                    FERNANDO
            Look, Father!

    Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the
    mule and into the crowd.   

                    COLUMBUS
            Fernando!

    But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people.
    COLUMBUS tries to follow him.  Flames leap into the night
    sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with
    a lurid glow.  Prayers are being chanted somewhere.

    FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.

    A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a
    MAN bound to a post.  The heretic wears the "sambenito", a
    robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been
    crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs,
    indicating that the man is Jewish.

    THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear.  But he refuses to kiss
    the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.

    FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't
    realize what is happening.  He is too close to the
    platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.

                    COLUMBUS
            Fernando!

    He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him
    away from the scene.  But FERNANDO looks back.  The
    distance now allows him to see inside the flames.

    A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a
    silent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the
    head falls on one shoulder.  Then the whole body collapses
    into the fire.


    INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT

    COLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed,
    stone-floored hallway of the modest house.  FERNANDO is
    mute, shocked by what he just witnessed.  COLUMBUS takes
    the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother,
    BEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them.  She is a
    beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic
    personality.  COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair.  FERNANDO
    glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say
    anything.


    INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

    COLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is
    cooking.  He explains Fernando's subdued manner.

                    COLUMBUS
            Executions.  In the square.

    BEATRIX nods.  He goes to the stone butt and pours water
    on his hands.

                    COLUMBUS
            They've agreed to see me in a week.

    BEATRIX puts the candle on the table.  Her face lights up
    with a smile.  He walks to her, and kisses her.

                    COLUMBUS
            I could be gone for years.

                    BEATRIX
            I know.

                    COLUMBUS
            I haven't given you much of a life.

                    BEATRIX
                (amused)
            Well... that's true.  I have a child
            by a man who won't marry me!  Who's
            always leaving...

                    COLUMBUS
            Are we going to argue?

                    BEATRIX
            I'd love to argue with you
            sometimes.  But you're never here!

    They laugh and kiss.

                    COLUMBUS
            Perhaps I was never meant to live
            with a woman...

                    BEATRIX
                (still kissing him)
            I find that hard to believe.

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

    INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

    They are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is
    unusually silent and thoughtful.  COLUMBUS pours a little
    wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.  FERNANDO
    looks up at him, surprised.  COLUMBUS smiles, then looks
    over at BEATRIX.

                    COLUMBUS
            Fernando, don't you think we are
            lucky to live with such a beautiful
            woman?

    He winks at FERNANDO.  BEATRIX smiles.


    INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

    The room is dark.  As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a
    candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX.  BEATRIX
    looks up at him intently.  A drop of wax falls on her
    skin.  She flinches, murmurs...

    They make love.


    EXT.  SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY

    A medieval "campus".  Students-novices are playing
    "pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball.  They run
    with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing
    white legs.  Others are studying, reading, hurrying to
    their class.

    We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above
    the court.  Others are waiting with him.  A MONK comes
    from a door, and looks around the group.

                    MONK
                (hesitant)
            Christopher Columbus?


    INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

    An El Greco painting.  A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on
    dark, sculpted seats.  Candles throw a gloomy light on
    their faces.  Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in
    bourgeois outfits.

    Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish
    fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of
    Aragon.  A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory
    claw at the top.  Languidly, he scratches his back -- his
    off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his
    peers.

                    AROJAZ
            You say Asia can be found by sailing
            west?

                    COLUMBUS
            Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage
            should not take more than six or
            seven weeks.

                    AROJAZ
            Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is
            precisely where our opinions
            differ...
                (pause)
            Are you familiar with the work of
            Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?

                    COLUMBUS
            I am, Your Eminence

                    AROJAZ
            Then you cannot ignore that
            according to their calculations, the
            circumference of the Earth is
            approximately...
                (he leans forward)
            22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes
            the ocean... uncrossable.

    He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.

                    AROJAZ
            But you may have found new evidence
            proving that these men of knowledge
            are totally mistaken!

    A ripple of mirthless laughter.

                    COLUMBUS
            Your Excellencies are aware of the
            statements of Marin de Tyr?

                    HERNANDO DE TALAVERA
            We are.

                    COLUMBUS
            Then you are also aware that his
            theories contradict Ptolemeus... De
            Tyr believes the Ocean to be only
            750 leagues...

    A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the
    Commission.  But Columbus is determined to press his
    theories.

                    COLUMBUS
            The Florentine Toscanelli and the
            French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both
            think that Marin de Tyr is accurate
            in his calculations.  And therefore,
            that the ocean can be crossed.

    Indignant and amused murmurs.  DIEGO DE DEZA raises his
    voice to quiet the assembly.

                    DIEGO DE DEZA
            Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de
            Tyr is right...
                (the laughter
                subsides)
            Are we here to examine this proposal
            or not?

    Silence.

                    DIEGO DE DEZA
                (to Columbus)
            In your opinion, how long would the
            voyage be?

                    COLUMBUS
            Seven weeks.  Six, during the summer
            months.

    The murmur increases.

                    AROJAZ
            Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has
            been corrected many times over the
            centuries by the finest geographers.
            Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a
            year!

    A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as
    being a seaman, interrupts.

                    VICUNA
            How would the crew survive without
            being able to land for fresh water?
            Water is undrinkable after six
            weeks!  You'd never be able to turn
            back!

                    COLUMBUS
            We wouldn't have to turn back!  We
            would find land at this point!

                    AROJAZ
            Senor Colon, an experienced captain
            such as yourself will understand our
            concern with the crew.  I am not
            willing to have on my conscience the
            loss of men who would have relied
            upon our judgment.

                    COLUMBUS
            Excellency, you are right.

    Instantly, the protests stop.

                    COLUMBUS
            I am a seaman, not a scholar... But
            as a simple man craving for
            knowledge, I have read all the work
            of these renowned geographers and
            discovered that none of them could
            agree on the exact width of this
            ocean...

    He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as
    a lawyer before a grand jury.

                    COLUMBUS
            Therefore, as a modest man, I
            wonder:  who is right?

    The experts listen.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ'S FACE, impressed by
    the boldness.

                    COLUMBUS
            Who is right?  This question remains
            unanswered.

    He walks and stops before TALAVERA, and catches the look
    of SANCHEZ, sitting just behind him.

                    COLUMBUS
            Your Eminence, there is only one way
            to settle the matter.  And that is
            to make the journey.
                (to the assembly,
                with passion)
            I am ready to risk my life to prove
            it possible.

                    AROJAZ
            Your life, and that of others!

                    COLUMBUS
            If they agree to follow me, yes.

                    SANCHEZ (O.S.)
            Suppose you cross this ocean.
            Suppose you reach Asia.  What would
            Spain do there?

    Conscious of a friendlier voice, COLUMBUS sees the
    Treasurer SANCHEZ, an imposing man in his fifties.

                    COLUMBUS
            Trade, Your Excellency.  According
            to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China
            is one of the richest of the world.
            Even the meanest buildings are
            roofed with gold.

                    AROJAZ
                (interrupting)
            Is that all that interests you?
            Gold?

                    COLUMBUS
            No.  The Portuguese have already
            discovered black-skinned people.  I,
            too, will find other populations --
            and bring them to the word of God.

    THE MONK smiles thinly.

                    AROJAZ
            Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the
            Bearer of the Cross!

                    MONK
                (ironic)
            And Colon -- the one who populates!

    Another small rill of laughter.

                    AROJAZ
            If God intended our proximity to
            Asia, do you believe he would have
            waited for you to show it to the
            world?

                    COLUMBUS
            Did He not choose a carpenter's son
            to reveal Himself to the world?

    A hum of interest.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ -- watching COLUMBUS
    intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.

                    AROJAZ
            So you consider yourself the chosen
            one?

    A pause.

                    AROJAZ
            Don't you realize your words could
            be considered heretical?

                    COLUMBUS
                (calmly)
            Blind faith is what I consider
            heresy!

    The murmur turns to an audible gasp.  AROJAZ gets to his
    feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a
    candle only inches from his face.

    There is absolute silence.  COLUMBUS meets the MONK'S gaze
    unflinchingly.

                    COLUMBUS
                (quietly)
            Asia can be found to the west -- and
            I will prove it.

                    AROJAZ
            IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!


    EXT.  TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAY

    The JURY is alone to deliberate.  Food and wine has been
    laid out on tables.  In the distance, students' cries
    carry over the conversation.

    SANCHEZ approaches.

                    AROJAZ
            The Treasurer of Spain honors us
            with his presence.

    SANCHEZ bows slightly.

                    SANCHEZ
            The State has some reason to be
            interested in this man's
            proposition, Your Eminence...

                    AROJAZ
            The Judgment is ours!

                    SANCHEZ
            Naturally.  But I would really
            deplore the loss of such a potential
            opportunity for Spain for a...
            dispute over a point of geography.

    SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the
    other members of the committee, who pretend not to be
    listening.

                    AROJAZ
                (interrupting)
            He is a mercenary!  Did he not
            already try to convince the King of
            Portugal of his absurd notions?

                    SANCHEZ
            Indeed.  The world is full of
            mercenaries -- and states often make
            use of them, when it benefits them.
                (casually)
            My only concern is the welfare and
            prosperity of Spain.

    AROJAZ understands the hint, and stops smiling.

                    AROJAZ
            You would use your influence to
            assist this... intriguer?

    SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry.

                    SANCHEZ
            You know, Your Eminence, the
            fascinating thing about power, is
            that what can be given so
            effortlessly...

    He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts
    his glass.  But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter,
    pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table,
    leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass.

                    SANCHEZ
            ... can so easily be taken away.

    And he drinks with a smile.


    INT.  LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENING

    MARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter.

                    MARCHENA
            ... and therefore nothing could
            justify the participation of Your
            Highnesses in the venture that
            relies upon such feeble assumptions,
            and which any man of knowledge
            would take to be impractical... if
            not impossible.

    He shakes his head, puts the letter down.  COLUMBUS looks
    appalled; devastated.

                    COLUMBUS
            They didn't listen.  They didn't
            want to listen!

    He paces about the book-lined room.

                    MARCHENA
            You mustn't give way to despair.
            You must wait.

                    COLUMBUS
            Wait!  I've waited seven years
            already!  How much longer do you
            want me to wait?

                    MARCHENA
            If God intends you to go, then you
            will go.

                    COLUMBUS
                (angrily)
            Damn God!

    MARCHENA is shocked.

                    MARCHENA
            Colon!

                    COLUMBUS
            Damn all of you!  You all set up
            theories based on what?  You never
            leave the safety of your studies!
            Go out!  Find out what the world is
            about and then tell me something I
            can listen to!

    He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.

                    COLUMBUS
            These don't mean anything!  They're
            full of assumptions!  Out of the
            heads of old men who've never been
            past the end of their gardens!

    He hurls the book across the room.  MARCHENA is horrified.

                    MARCHENA
            No...!  My books...!

    COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping
    them to the floor.

                    COLUMBUS
            All of them!  Just lies!

                    MARCHENA
            Colon!  Don't!

    MARCHENA tries to stop him.  In his fury, COLUMBUS
    accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground.  His
    cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room.

    As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books
    everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this
    big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect.  Finally, a
    short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends
    COLUMBUS crashing to the floor.


    INT.  CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING

    COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor.  He is dressed
    in a homespun robe.  His arms are stretched out in
    penance.  FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him.

                    FERNANDO
            Father?

                    DIEGO
            Sssshhhh...!  One can't speak to a
            man doing penance.

                    FERNANDO
            What can you do?

                    DIEGO
            Nothing.  That's the point,
            Fernando.

    A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor
    beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same
    way.  DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to
    join them.


    EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

    Along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry
    in the light breeze.  COLUMBUS pins up a new addition.
    Another MONK works nearby, in silence.

                    PINZON (O.S.)
            Senor Colon?

    COLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching:  a
    middle-class gentleman.  He nods.

                    PINZON
            Ah, thank God!  I've been looking
            all over Seville for you!  Never
            expected to find a sailor in a
            monastery, eh?

    He laughs.  COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything.
    PINZON is clearly a little surprised.

                    PINZON
            Name's Pinzon, by the way.  Martin
            Alonzo Pinzon.  I'm a ship owner
            from Palos...

    COLUMBUS glances around cautiously, and walks a little way
    down the cloister, away from the other MONK, gesturing for
    PINZON to follow him.  PINZON is yet more surprised by
    this strange behavior.

                    PINZON
                (indicating the
                monk)
            Is he a spy?

    COLUMBUS shakes his head.  PINZON stares at him,
    perplexed.

                    PINZON
            What is it?  Are you a Trappist?

    COLUMBUS shakes his head again.

                    PINZON
            Vow of silence...?  Penance?

    COLUMBUS nods vigorously.

                    PINZON
            Jesus!  Just my luck!

    He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk
    cloth.

                    PINZON
            Listen.  I'll do the talking for
            both of us.  You just nod.  Agreed?
            Just as I do with the wife.

    COLUMBUS nods.

                    PINZON
            I know that the Commission turned
            you down, right?  What do you
            expect?  You're a foreigner... But I
            want to help you.

    COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in
    the air.

                    PINZON
            You wonder why I believe in you?
            Hey, I am a seaman.  And we don't
            like to be told where to go, and
            where not to go.

    COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing.  The other
    MONK looks round severely.  COLUMBUS ducks behind a map,
    PINZON following him.  PINZON lowers his voice.

                    PINZON
            I don't look like it, but I have
            friends at the Court.  The Treasurer
            of Aragon, for example.  He finances
            me.  His name's Santangel.  Ever
            heard of him?

    COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly
    interested by what he's hearing.

                    PINZON
            He can get you an audience with the
            Queen!  You know why...?  She owes
            him money.  That's how it is.  You
            -- me -- the Queen -- the world and
            his mistress -- agreed?

    COLUMBUS nods.

                    PINZON
            So.  What do you say?

    COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of
    the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:

                    COLUMBUS
            Where can I meet this man?

                    PINZON
                (indicating with a
                nod)
            Immediately.

    COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties,
    examining the maps.


    EXT.  STREETS OF GRANADA - DAY

    A huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret
    of a mosque.  SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the
    foot of the tower.  To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a
    Cross is hoisted up in its place... Astride horses,
    COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the
    scene.

    They push through an extraordinary scene.  The city of
    Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after
    several years of siege.  All around them, SPANISH SOLDIERS
    are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS,
    bearing only a few possessions.  Ragged, half-starved men,
    women and children.

                    SANTANGEL
            These people built Granada...
            Centuries ago!  It is a great
            victory over the Moors, Don Colon --
            and yet what a tragedy it is!

    The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful
    PENITENTS, who are crawling on their knees, chanting
    psalms and flagellating themselves.  At the head of the
    procession, HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin
    Mary swathed in silk and lace.

    The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight.

                    COLUMBUS
            Is this a good time to meet her?

                    SANTANGEL
            It couldn't be better.  Victors
            can't say no.

    Bells are pealing triumphantly.  The noise is tumultuous.
    They ride towards the magnificent palace.


    EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

    Fabulous Moorish gardens:  ponds filled with golden carp;
    exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... The distant
    sounds of victory.

    SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens, escorted
    by HALBERDIERS.  SOLDIERS pass by, carrying coffers or
    piles of documents.

    As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are
    fewer people.  They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where
    several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience.

    SANCHEZ appears.  They bow.  SANTANGEL approaches to
    murmur a compliment.

                    SANTANGEL
            Your Excellency... truly grateful...
            your help... as ever...

    SANCHEZ protests softly, and looks over at COLUMBUS, a
    half-smile forming on his lips.  Then a DUENA appears, and
    motions for COLUMBUS to follow.


    INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

    An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand.
    We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades,
    mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of
    Granada's rooftops.

    Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of
    QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN.  The light in her blonde hair
    creates a halo around her head as she turns.  COLUMBUS
    falls to his knees.

                    ISABEL
            Rise...!  Come forward!

    He approaches the window, stopping close to her.  ISABEL
    scrutinizes him quickly.

                    ISABEL
            I should not even be listening to
            you, since my council said no.  But
            Santangel tells me you are a man of
            honor and sincerity... And Sanchez,
            that you are not a fool.

                    COLUMBUS
                (bold)
            No more than the woman who said she
            would take Granada from the Moors.

    ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.

                    ISABEL
            The ocean is uncrossable?

                    COLUMBUS
            What did they say about Granada
            before today?

                    ISABEL
                (a beat)
            That she was impregnable.

    ISABEL smiles again.

                    ISABEL
            I cannot ignore the verdict of my
            council.

                    COLUMBUS
            Surely you can do anything you want.

    A direct challenge.  She doesn't know what to make of this
    man.

                    ISABEL
            How little you know.

    This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their
    positions for a moment.  Now we sense COLUMBUS
    scrutinizing her.

                    COLUMBUS
            May I speak freely?

                    ISABEL
                (with a smile)
            You show no inclination to speak
            otherwise!

                    COLUMBUS
            I know what I see.  I see someone
            who doesn't accept the world as it
            is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a
            women who thinks... "What if?"...

                    ISABEL
                (amused at his
                familiarity)
            A woman?

    A slight pause.

                    COLUMBUS
            Forgive me... but you're the only
            Queen I know.

    She bursts out laughing.

                    ISABEL
            Then we are equal... since you are
            the only sailor I know!

    A beat.

                    ISABEL
            How old are you, Senor Colon?

                    COLUMBUS
            Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And
            you?

    Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away
    slightly to hide it.

                    ISABEL
            Thirty eight...

    A pause.

                    ISABEL
            You will be informed of our
            decision.

    COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave.  As the DUENA opens the
    door for him, he turns back.

                    COLUMBUS
            Actually, I thought you were younger
            than me!

    And he goes out, leaving her stunned.


    EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY

    A chalk white road, lined with trees.  Two liveried
    SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large
    silver tray, the other a smaller tray.

    They are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along
    the road, with documents under his arm.


    EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAY

    The CLERK enters an imposing stable block.

    In the paddock, SANCHEZ is training a magnificent young
    horse, making it step sideways, bending it to his will.
    The ADMINISTRATOR watches him, unable to interrupt.

    Behind him the two SERVANTS can be seen bringing in the
    silver trays, with covered dishes of food, a decanter of
    wine.  They begin to lay them out on a table.


    EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - LATER

    SANCHEZ pours himself some wine, tucks into his his food,
    while the ADMINISTRATOR, clearly working himself up into a
    frenzy, reads from a document.

                    ADMINISTRATOR
            ... and he demands... he DEMANDS to
            be made a Knight, with the right to
            bear the Golden Spurs!  He will
            receive the title of Don Cristobal
            Colon -- which will be extended to
            his descendants for ever more...

    The ADMINISTRATOR looks up.  He is reading the contract
    that COLUMBUS has proposed.  SANCHEZ, his mouth full,
    gestures for him to continue.

                    SANCHEZ
            Go on!

                    ADMINISTRATOR
            He will be named Great Admiral of
            the Ocean Sea.  Viceroy of the West
            Indies... Governor of all islands or
            lands discovered or as will be
            discovered with his help...

    The ADMINISTRATOR looks up again.

                    ADMINISTRATOR
            The highest titles of nobility, Your
            Excellency!  To an immigrant
            sheltered by monks!

    SANCHEZ gestures for the document.  Wipes his mouth.
    Continues reading, calmly:

                    SANCHEZ
            Furthermore he will receive one
            eight of all wealth or monies,
            precious gems, pearls, metals,
            spices and other lucrative sources
            conquered within the boundaries of
            his admiralty...

    He smiles, hands the document back.

                    SANCHEZ
            It's very underdone.

                    ADMINISTRATOR
                (exploding)
            Underdone!  It's monstrous,
            Excellency!

                    SANCHEZ
            No, the pheasant.  It's almost raw.

    And he carries on eating.

                    SANCHEZ
            You worry too much, Carvajal... The
            man will have to lower his demands.
            Believe me, he WILL!


    INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

    Close up on COLUMBUS.

                    COLUMBUS
            I WON'T!

    A WOMAN'S HAND quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy
    hole in the wall.  Two beautiful eyes peer through a
    grille, into the next room.

    What they see:

    SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together.  COLUMBUS is visibly upset.

                    SANCHEZ
                (calmly)
            We have considered your -- demands
            very carefully, Senor Colon... Your
            expectations are... excessive, in
            every way.

    COLUMBUS tightens his fists, tries to remain calm.

                    COLUMBUS
            If I am right, my requests are fair!

    SANCHEZ holds up a document.

                    SANCHEZ
            We have prepared our own contract...

    He offers the document to COLUMBUS, who takes it, scans it
    quickly, shakes his head.

                    COLUMBUS
            No...

                    SANCHEZ
            No?

                    COLUMBUS
            NO...!  I have waited too long,
            fought too hard.  Now you expect me
            to take all the risks while you take
            the profit!  No... I will not be
            your servant!

    The eyes behind the screen -- the mouth, forming a little
    smile.

                    SANCHEZ
            I remind you, Senor Colon, that you
            are in no position to bargain with
            me.

                    COLUMBUS
            I'm not bargaining!

                    SANCHEZ
                (steely)
            Then you are too ambitious.

    COLUMBUS leans over the table, faces him.

                    COLUMBUS
            And were you never ambitious,
            Excellency?  Or is ambition only a
            virtue among the nobles, a fault for
            the rest of us?

                    SANCHEZ
                (abrupt)
            If you won't accept our proposal,
            we'll simply find someone who will.

    COLUMBUS smiles.

                    COLUMBUS
            If you can do that, Excellency --
            I'll become a monk!

    He turns, strides towards the door.  We hear a WOMAN'S
    muffled laughter.

    As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret
    door.  SANCHEZ bows.

    ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out.

                    ISABEL
            You were right, Don Sanchez... His
            demands could never be granted.

                    SANCHEZ
            Never, Your Majesty.  Although...

    She turns, questioningly, towards him.

                    SANCHEZ
            ... Although one may always
            renegotiate a contract.  Especially
            signed by Royal Hands.


    EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE GARDENS - POV - DAY

    SANCHEZ joins ISABEL at the window.  They see COLUMBUS
    striding out and away.


    INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

    BACK TO SANCHEZ

                    SANCHEZ
                (quietly)
            ... Into a monk...

                    ISABEL
                (with a smile)
            Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't
            it?
                (turning to Sanchez)
            Call him back!


    EXT.  STREET - EVENING   

    Teeming life.  COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds.
    He is expressionless and distracted.

    He looks around him, stops walking.  And then,
    unexpectedly, shouts.

                    COLUMBUS
            YEEEEEEES!

    All heads turn as if he were totally insane.  He walks on
    as if nothing happened.


    INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

    COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with
    a glass of wine.  There is a movement behind him.  BEATRIX
    is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt.

    COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad.

                    COLUMBUS
            She said yes.

                    BEATRIX
                (moved)
            Thank God...

    She smiles.  But he seems to be unable to share her
    happiness.

                    COLUMBUS
            If I ever come back, I swear I
            will...

    She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his
    mouth.

                    BEATRIX
                (softly)
            I'm not asking you to swear to
            anything.

                    COLUMBUS
            I don't want you to wait for me.

                    BEATRIX
                (smiling)
            That's something you can't decide.

    COLUMBUS kisses her.


    INT.  CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

    Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark
    tunnel.  FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks
    slowly down the dark corridor.

    Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study.


    INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT

    CLOSE ON:  A huge illustrated map of western Europe and
    Asia.  FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic
    Ocean, to the edge of the map.  There, the illustrator's
    imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons;
    creatures half-human, half-animal.

    Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.

                    FERNANDO (O.S.)
            You can't go there!

    Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him.

                    COLUMBUS
            Why not?

    FERNANDO points at the monsters.  He pulls the boy to him.

                    COLUMBUS
            There aren't any monsters, Fernando.
            The only monsters are in here...
                (he taps his own
                forehead)
            Watch!

    He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible
    monsters, transforming it at once.  FERNANDO laughs
    immediately.

                    FERNANDO
            I want to go with you!

                    COLUMBUS
            There'll be a time.

                    FERNANDO
            You promise?
                (Columbus nods his
                head)
            Do you swear on St. Christopher...?

    FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St. Christopher medal
    from under COLUMBUS' shirt.

                    FERNANDO
            Do you swear on all the Holy Saints
            in heaven?

                    COLUMBUS
                (laughing)
            Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!

    And he hugs his SON tightly.


    EXT.  HILLSIDE AND GATE - PRE-DAWN

    A luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate,
    down to the harbor.  We see the faces of the SAILORS and
    their FAMILIES -- COLUMBUS, PINZON AMONGST THEM -- We
    sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure.  The
    procession is lead by MARCHENA and four young NOVICES
    carrying the Madonna.  All hold long, burning tapers,
    saying the rosary.  A SAILOR pushes through the crowd, and
    kisses the Madonna's feet.


    EXT.  PALOS HARBOR - DAWN

    Hundreds of candles flicker in the pre-dawn light, held by
    the FAMILIES and FRIENDS of the SAILORS.

    The SANTA MARIA the PINTA and the NINA nestle against the
    quayside.  Dwarfed by the hulls, a flotilla of smaller
    fishing craft, returning from night fishing, accidentally
    witness this event.


    EXT.  MAKESHIFT CONFESSIONAL - DOCKSIDE - DAWN

    MARCHENA sits on a barrel and crosses himself.  Behind a
    curtain sits COLUMBUS.

                    MARCHENA
            In Nomine Patris et Filius, et
            Spiritus Sancti.

                    COLUMBUS
            Forgive me, Father.  For I have
            sinned.

    MARCHENA recognizes COLUMBUS' voice.

                    MARCHENA
            I am listening, my son.

                    COLUMBUS
            Father, I have betrayed my family.
            I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed
            you.

                    MARCHENA
            What are you saying?

                    COLUMBUS
            I lied.  The journey will be longer
            than I said.

                    MARCHENA
            How long?

                    COLUMBUS
            I am not sure... It could be twice
            the distance.

    A pause.

                    MARCHENA
            May God forgive you...!  You must
            tell them!  You must tell your men!

                    COLUMBUS
            If I tell them, they won't follow
            me.  You know that I am right,
            Father.  You trust me...

                    MARCHENA
            My son, my son...
                (he shakes his head)
            Your certitudes are sometimes
            frightening...
                (pause)
            Christopher, you must speak to them.
            And if you don't I will.

                    COLUMBUS
            You are bound by an oath, Father.

    A long silence.

                    MARCHENA
            I believed in you...

                    COLUMBUS
            Give me absolution.

    No response.

                    COLUMBUS
            Give me absolution, Father!

    Devastated, MARCHENA reluctantly makes the sign of the
    cross.


    EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - PALOS - DAWN

    COLUMBUS walks over to where BEATRIX and FERNANDO are
    waiting.  He kisses and hugs FERNANDO.

                    MARCHENA (O.S.)
            Ispo Te Absoluto.  May God forgive
            you and have mercy on your soul,
            Christopher Columbus.  Go in peace.

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

    EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - DAWN - LATER

    The CROWDED QUAYSIDE.  COLUMBUS stands in front of
    FERNANDO.

                    COLUMBUS
            Be good to your mother, Fernando.
            Do you promise?

    FERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes.  Then COLUMBUS embraces
    BEATRIX tightly.  She whispers into his ear.

                    BEATRIX
            Speak to Diego.

    But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and
    instead they clumsily hug.  Someone taps COLUMBUS'
    shoulder.  He turns around to see SANTANGEL.  Wordlessly,
    they hug.

                                    CUT TO:

    Activity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes
    fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water... Now
    the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside.  The
    CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS.  WOMEN
    holding up babies, blowing kisses, old PARENTS crying...
    BEATRIX, HER SONS, AND SANTANGEL are among them.

    COLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and
    throws it at DIEGO.

                    COLUMBUS
            Diego!  Here!

    DIEGO catches it.  Opening his hand he looks at the
    medallion.  Then looks up at his FATHER, elated.

    THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY.
    SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS.

                    SANTANGEL
                (casually)
            Take care of my investment, wherever
            you're going!

                    COLUMBUS
                (ambiguous)
            I have to tell you Santangel.  I
            don't know where on earth I am
            going!

    They both laugh.

    A FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand
    slide gently along the gigantic hull.  He stares up at the
    SAILORS leaning on the rail.

                    SAILOR
            Vaya con Dios!  (Go with God!)

    They wave back.

                                    CUT TO:

    MARCHENA walking towards the Moorish gate.  He finally
    turns, sad and distraught.  He sees:

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY

    THREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN.

    The sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath.
    A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable
    metamorphosis.  Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety
    of the crew, the fear of the unknown...

    ENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging
    majestically through the waves.  Sinking back,
    disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music.


    EXT.  DECK - DAY

    A SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck.

    A SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast.

    A COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of
    the evening meal.

    TEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail,
    punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - NIGHT

    The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an
    instrument.

    COLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the
    prow.  Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars.

    SOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity.  One of them is
    ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque.

    Near COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts.  He
    makes an entry in the log.  Then goes back to his
    quadrant.  He senses MENDEZ standing next to him.

                    COLUMBUS
                (softly)
            Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may
            God be with us...

                    MENDEZ
            God be with us admiral.

    MENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS.

                    COLUMBUS
            What is it Mendez?  Speak!

    MENDEZ is hesitant.  He nervously clears his throat.

                    MENDEZ
            Well... It's the men, Sir.  They
            wonder how you know our position.
            We've lost sight from land days
            ago...

                    COLUMBUS
                (still taking
                readings)
            And what do you think Mendez?

                    MENDEZ
            Well, I surely know what a quadrant
            is!  But I've never seen it used at
            night before.

                    COLUMBUS
            Come over here.

    MENDEZ hesitates, then motions to COLUMBUS.  The SAILORS
    are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation.

                    COLUMBUS
            Now, find the North Star.  Do you
            have it?

                                    CUT TO:

    The picture swims across the heavens, until we see the
    north star.

                    COLUMBUS (O.S.)
            Steady yourself...!  Keep the plumb
            line vertical...

    The picture steadies.

                                    CUT TO:

    MENDEZ nods -- and loses equilibrium.  The plumb line
    swings.

                    COLUMBUS
            Don't move!  A mistake of one degree
            and we'll be off 6,000 leagues!

    MENDEZ tries again.

                    COLUMBUS
            What do you read?

                    MENDEZ
            Twenty eight.

    MENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS.

                    COLUMBUS
            That's it.  The twenty eighth
            parallel.  And we'll follow it until
            we reach land.

    ALONSO does not seem convinced.

                    ALONSO
            How do you know land is on the
            twenty eighth parallel?


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

    A blazing sun.  The ship is like a furnace, its brass
    fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the
    air shimmer over the decks.

    Desperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the
    sagging prow sail.

    The SHIP'S BOY throws an empty bucket attached to a rope
    over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with
    water.  As he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair
    lip.  He drenches himself... From the shade, ALONSO
    watches him.

                    ALONSO
            Chicken-ass face!

    The others laugh.  The BOY, ashamed, tries to ignore them.
    ALONSO'S hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he
    reacts like he was burnt.

                    ALONSO
            Shit!

    He sucks his blistered fingers.

                    ALONSO
            I never seen heat like this!  Not
            even in Las Minas!

                    SAILOR
            The water's going putrid in the
            barrels.

                    ALONSO
            You'll be drinking your own piss...
            For the glory of Spain... and
            Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!

    The SHIP'S BOY glances round at them.

                    ALONSO
            What are you listening to, chicken
            ass?

                    SAILOR
            Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no
            harm.

                    ALONSO
            With a face like that?
                (to boy)
            I don't want you looking at me.  You
            hear?

    The BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.

                    ALONSO
            He's the devil's child...

                    SAILOR
            We'll all go crazy...

    The BOY throws more water over the deck.  A SAILOR takes
    his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song.

                    SAILOR
            Culo de galina es el hijo del
            demonio... (Chicken ass mouth is the
            devil's child... Born from the loins
            of a stinky old goat etc...)

    They all laugh.  The BOY, hearing this, climbs to the
    crow's-nest like a monkey.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - RIGGING AND CROW'S-NEST - DAY

    We experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the
    main mast, high above the rolling deck.

    The BOY curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's-nest,
    exhausted by the heat, and scared.  His eyes are turning
    white.  He begins to piss himself...

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

    Piss is dripping on the deck.  THE SAILORS do not seem to
    care.  THE COOK takes a chicken from a cage.  He breaks
    its neck, and starts plucking it.  The OTHERS continue
    their bitter conversation.

                    ALONSO
            We should have seen land.

                    SAILOR
            We left three weeks ago, Alonso.
            Can't be that near.

                    ALONSO
            Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I
            don't like the smell of the sea
            around here.  Smells like a cunt.
            Bad sign...

    The COOK starts laughing.  They turn to him.

                    COOK
                (shaking his head)
            Of course it smells like it!  That's
            why sailors take to the sea!

    They all laugh.  Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on
    the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the
    land to appear.

                    ALONSO
            And why does this one take to the
            sea?  Nobody knows.  Never says a
            word...

    MENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect.  He
    approaches them.

                    MENDEZ
            To your post!  At once!

    They split in silence.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

    The SHIP is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind -- SAILORS
    sleep on deck.

    The SHIP'S BOY is singing to himself.  Despite his hair
    lip he has a pure, melancholy voice...

    COLUMBUS, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears
    it carry over the darkness.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

    CLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS, nearly through its time.

    The SHIP'S BOY throws an "ampoulette" over board.  We
    follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full
    length of the hull.  As it reaches the poop deck, another
    SAILOR shouts "MARK".  A very primitive system of
    calculation for distance and speed.

    Sitting near the SHIP'S BOY, COLUMBUS is making entries in
    a log-book, watching the hourglass.

                    SHIP'S BOY
            Mark.  Twenty nine, Sir!

    THE HOUR-GLASS runs out.  COLUMBUS converts the mark into
    a daily average for distance and speed.

                    COLUMBUS
            Six hundred and twenty nine.

    THE SHIP'S BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout.

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  PINTA - DAY

    PINZON, his OFFICERS beside him, looks across at the SANTA
    MARIA.

                    SHIP'S BOY
            Six hundred and twenty nine!

    AN OFFICER turns to PINZON to repeat the message.

                    OFFICER
            Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir!

    PINZON does not seem too pleased.

                    PINZON
            I heard.

    THE OFFICER examines his own calculations.

                    OFFICER
            Captain, I don't understand.

                    PINZON
            I think I do.

    He goes back to his cabin.

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  SHIPS - SARGASSO SEA - DAY

    ABSOLUTE STILLNESS.  A FURNACE.  The three ships like
    dots, on what seems to be a prairie of weed.

    The caravels are being towed by three rowing boats.

    CLOSE ON THE MEN, rowing, drenched with sweat.

    FROM THE PROW, COLUMBUS is staring at the horizon.

    ALONSO pulling at his oars stares at COLUMBUS' distant
    figure with hate and resentment.

    ALONSO suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat
    into disarray.  Chaos.

    Total silence.  MENDEZ and ALONSO stare at each other.

                    MENDEZ
            Continue rowing!

                    ALONSO
            To where?

    ALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ.  He then starts to beat
    a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the
    others.  In the two other boats, the MEN begin to follow
    suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls.

    MENDEZ looks up to COLUMBUS, in panic.

    ON BOARD PINZON'S SHIP, an OFFICER cups his hands to his
    mouth.

                    OFFICER
            Captain Pinzon requests permission
            to board.

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DAY

                    COLUMBUS
            Granted.


    INT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - DAY

    PINZON enters.  He looks furious.

                    PINZON
            You lied!  You cheated!  We're way
            past 750 leagues!

                    COLUMBUS
                (calmly)
            Six days ago, yes.

                    PINZON
            You must be mad...!

                    COLUMBUS
            We have to keep the hopes of these
            men alive!

                    PINZON
            We're on the verge of a mutiny,
            Colon!

                    COLUMBUS
            You think I don't know that?

                    PINZON
            We're lost!

                    COLUMBUS
            The land is there.  I know it!

                    PINZON
            You don't know anything!  Listen
            Colon, these are my ships, right?
            So I'm telling you we're turning
            back!

                    COLUMBUS
            And then what?  Half of the water
            has gone, the rest is nearly putrid!
            You know that!

                    PINZON
                (apoplectic)
            Jesus Maria!  I should have never
            listened to you!

                    COLUMBUS
            You never did.  You did all the
            talking for both of us, remember?

                    PINZON
            You bloody...

                    COLUMBUS
            Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now
            is go forward!  Think about that!

                    PINZON
            You tell that to them!

                    COLUMBUS
            You're right.  Let the men decide.

    COLUMBUS moves to the door.  As an afterthought, he takes
    his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

    Most of the men are now back on board.

    They go silent as COLUMBUS appears.  He walks slowly over
    to them.  All, including ALONSO, are surly, threatening...

                    COLUMBUS
            Who gave you the order to come on
            board?

    He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO.  They
    stare at one another.

                    ALONSO
            God doesn't want us to cross the
            ocean...!  This voyage is cursed!

    Some of the MEN murmur their agreement.

                    COLUMBUS
            Cursed?

                    ALONSO
            We set sail for greed.  God has
            abandoned us.  The voyage is cursed.
            There are signs...

    ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip.
    The BOY lowers his eyes.  COLUMBUS moves towards him,
    pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.

                    COLUMBUS
            This boy has the voice of an angel.
            What comes out of his mouth is
            blessed, Alonso.  What comes out of
            your is evil.

    Some of the men laugh at this statement.  ALONSO is ill at
    ease.  COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN.

                    COLUMBUS
            Listen to me!  Every man is afraid
            who does something for the first
            time.  But those who overcome their
            fears, will find their rewards.  I
            do not know if it is God's will that
            we cross this ocean -- but I am
            certain it is the devil who puts
            fears into our hearts...

    The MEN are listening.  We sense a subtle change of
    mood...

                    COLUMBUS
            This jacket to the first man who
            sights land!  I want a man up that
            mast day and night.

    COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.

                    COLUMBUS
            You start first.

    The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast.  As he climbs, the
    mainsail starts to fill with wind.  The deck begins to
    move under their feet.

    This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly
    erase the fears and the angers.

                    MENDEZ
            Alonso!  Jaime!  Don't let this wind
            escape us.

    CRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut,
    filling with wind.  MEN rush to their posts.  PINZON
    stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief.

                    PINZON
                (murmuring)
            You lucky bastard...

    COLUMBUS walks away to his cabin, then turning back to
    PINZON.

                    COLUMBUS
            Pinzon, the more I sail, the luckier
            I get.

    Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHT

    COLUMBUS is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his
    cape, struggling against the sleep.  MENDEZ approaches him
    with a bowl of soup.

                    MENDEZ
            Shall I take my turn?

    COLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the
    bowl.

    CREDITS AND MUSIC OVER:

    INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY

    We start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a
    splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the
    garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate
    hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large
    topaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing
    on marble floors.

                                    CUT TO:

    A Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion,
    dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is
    TREASURER SANCHEZ.

    A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We
    can now here a subdued conversation.

    TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:

    The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.
    A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN
    ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.

    He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large
    table.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and
    three dignitaries of Church and State.

    All sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document
    and starts to read aloud.

    On screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500

                    SANCHEZ
            Your Majesty would wish to know the
            true facts concerning the island of
            Hispanola, our first settlement in
            the New World, and the activities
            there of your servant, Christopher
            Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,
            Governor of that Island.  You will
            remember with what hopes and
            promises he beguiled us -- the truth
            is that he now presides over a state
            of chaos, degradation and madness
            beyond imagining.

    SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.

                    SANCHEZ
            From the beginning, Columbus proved
            himself incapable of managing the
            affairs of the island.  He appointed
            his brothers to important positions,
            at once injuring the pride and
            dignity of the nobles who had gone
            with him.  He promised to build a
            city, the City of Isabel, named
            after Your Majesty.  What he
            actually built was nothing but a
            collection of huts, and that in the
            wrong place, for all of it was
            easily swept away by rain and mud.
            Is that not so, Brother Buyl?

    The PRIEST nods.

                    BROTHER BUYL
            Yes, Your Honor.

                    SANCHEZ
            He promised gold.  Not finding the
            easy quantities he promised,
            Columbus commanded each Indian to
            pay an annual tribute.  Most being
            unable to, they were barbarously
            punished, against the express wish
            of Your Christian Majesties...

    ISABEL lowers her eyes.

                    SANCHEZ
            Since provocation and injustice
            never ceases, many of the Indians
            have fled to the forests, or have
            begun to slay the Christians.

    ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.

                    ISABEL
            Could it be so?

                    BROTHER BUYL
            Yes, Your Majesty.

                    SANCHEZ
            But there is worse.  From the
            beginning, he forced the nobles to
            undergo physical labor, treating
            them equally with the Indians, all
            of them reduced to slavery.  When
            the nobleman Adrian de Moxica
            protested against such treatment...
                (he pauses)
            ... he was executed.
                (pause)
            Is that not true also, Brother
            Buyl?

                    BROTHER BUYL
            Yes, Your Honor.  It is all true.
            All of it.  I saw it with my own
            eyes.

                    SANCHEZ
            He has lost control.  His great
            arrogance has led him into
            depravity.  He encourages our
            soldiers to marry the native women.
            He promised a paradise, but he has
            made a hell full of all its horrors.

    Silence.

                    ISABEL
            Is that the man I knew, Treasurer
            Sanchez?

                    SANCHEZ
            Yes, Your Majesty.

                                    CUT TO:

    INT.  HUT - ISLAND - DAY

    CLOSE ON the FACE:  COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed,
    sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious.  Insects
    crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away.
    There is a dripping sound of water.

                    FERNANDO (V.O.)
            Of all the words my Father wrote and
            there were many, I remember these
            the most.  "Nothing that results
            from human progress is achieved with
            unanimous consent..."

    Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a
    table.  COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table.  Some
    of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames.  A
    lizard scuttles into the shadows.

                    FERNANDO (V.O.)
            "And those who are enlightened
            before the others are condemned to
            purse that light in spite of
            others..."

    COLUMBUS stares down at the documents, moving them away
    from the rain drips.  He stares out by the window, and we
    see:

    A devastated landscape.  Flooded roads, half-destroyed
    huts, broken trees... A dog picks its way through the mud.

                    FERNANDO (V.O.)
            There was a time when the New World
            didn't exist...

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

    EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

    A vast stretch of ocean.  It fills the screen.  Unbroken,
    infinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away,
    meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl
    and misty light.

                    FERNANDO (V.O.)
            ... The sun set in the west on an
            ocean where no man had dared to
            venture.  And beyond that,
            infinity...

    Pulling back, we discover:

    A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle
    thirties, are riding a mule.  The MAN'S weather-beaten
    face frames unusually bright eyes.

    On the screen these words:  ANDALUSIA, 1491

    COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at
    the top of the hill.  COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO
    looks up at him in adoration.

                    FERNANDO (V.O.)
            Once I asked my Father where he
            wanted to go.  And he replied:  "I
            want to travel all over the seas.  I
            want to get behind the weather..."

    FERNANDO laughs.  He then starts to hum along with his
    FATHER.

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAY

    A rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone
    walls and thousands of sheep.

    FERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing
    the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him.  High-
    spirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.

    COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching
    his SON'S antics with amusement.  In the distance, the
    solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD.

    COLUMBUS calls out to his son:

                    COLUMBUS
            Fernando!

    FERNANDO runs over.  COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule.

    As they move along the track we now see, perched on a
    distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La
    Rabida, their destination.


    EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

    As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters,
    FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under
    the ROMAN arches.

                    FERNANDO
            Diego!

    He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an
    adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn,
    delicate face.  DIEGO'S response is constrained.

                    COLUMBUS
            Diego!  Aren't you going to kiss
            your brother?

    DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is
    immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS,
    hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.

    The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white-
    haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer.
    MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his
    arms to greet COLUMBUS.  He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns
    to DIEGO.

                    MARCHENA
            Diego, take Fernando to the dining
            hall.  He must be hungry.

                    DIEGO
            Yes, Father.

    Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof.  COLUMBUS and
    MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.

                    MARCHENA
            Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure
            to teach -- but so serious...
            Brothers should be raised together,
            Colon.  Even brothers from different
            mothers...

                    COLUMBUS
            Father, I am doing what I think is
            the best for him.  And he has the
            teacher I would have chosen for
            myself.

    MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.

                    MARCHENA
            Just be careful you don't lose him.

    They have crossed the cloister.  MARCHENA pushes open a
    door.


    INT.  A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY

    Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the
    miracle of printing, a recent German discovery.  Several
    MONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily
    "ILLUMINATING" some of these massive volumes, delicately
    painting around the letters in bright colors and gold
    leaf.

    Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings,
    projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor.  As
    MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is
    punctuated by light and shadow.

                    MARCHENA
                (fumbles in a pocket
                under his robe)
            I have something for you.

    Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.

                    MARCHENA
            You will be heard at the University
            of Salamanca...

    COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.  Almost frantically he
    tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.

                    COLUMBUS
            God... That's in a week!

                    MARCHENA
            That's what it says.

                    COLUMBUS
            How did you manage it?

                    MARCHENA
                (smiling)
            With some difficulty.  I had to
            promise them you were not a total
            fool.

    MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden
    panel.


    INT.  STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY

    MARCHENA is not a tidy man.  Books are piled up on the
    floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps,
    instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an
    inquiring mind.

    With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a
    hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits
    behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.  MARCHENA
    lights a candle and considers the mess.  Then
    methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him
    with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.

    When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his
    expression.  He turns over an hourglass.

                    MARCHENA
            Why do you wish to sail west?

                    COLUMBUS
            To open a new route to Asia.  At the
            moment there are only two ways of
            reaching it...

    He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the
    desk.

                    COLUMBUS
            By sea, sailing around the African
            Continent -- the journey takes a
            year...

    His finger traces the journey, from west to east.

                    COLUMBUS
            Or by land...

    We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger
    tracing a line between Europe and the Far East.

                    COLUMBUS (O.S.)
            ... But the Turks have closed this
            route to all Christians.  Trading
            with the Orient has become arduous,
            if not dangerous.
                (he pauses)
            There is a third way...

    We notice that the outline of the European continent is
    familiar.  But we also notice that, in that great expanse
    of ocean, the whole American continent is missing.

                    COLUMBUS
            By sailing West across the Ocean
            Sea.

    CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.

                    MARCHENA
            How can you be so certain?  The
            Ocean is said to be infinite.

                    COLUMBUS
            Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are
            no more than 750 leagues west of the
            Canary Islands.

                    MARCHENA
            How can you be so certain?

                    COLUMBUS
            The calculations of Toscanelli Marin
            de Tyr, Esdras...

                    MARCHENA
                (interrupting)
            Esdras is a Jew.

                    COLUMBUS
            So was Christ!

    MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration.  He
    glances at the hourglass:

                    MARCHENA
            Two minutes... and already you're a
            dead man.  Don't let passion
            overwhelm you, Colon.

                    COLUMBUS
                (mockingly)
            I'll try to remember that,
            Marchena...

                    MARCHENA
            Father Marchena!

                    COLUMBUS
                (ignoring this)
            Passion is something one cannot
            control!

                    MARCHENA
                (heatedly)
            You get so carried away when you are
            being contradicted!

                    COLUMBUS
            I've been contradicted all my
            life... Eternity!

                    MARCHENA
                (amused)
            Only God knows the meaning of such
            words, my son.


    EXT.  COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING

    DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS
    appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to
    go.

                    COLUMBUS
            Diego.

    COLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes
    meet.  He looks at his SON for a moment.

                    COLUMBUS
            Would you like to come and stay with
            us?

    Uncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an
    answer.

                    COLUMBUS
            I'll do whatever makes you happy.

                    DIEGO
            I am happy, Father.

    COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.

    He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his
    BROTHER as they ride off.


    EXT.  CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT

    COLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO,
    through narrow streets.  There's a clamorous noise in the
    air.  Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with
    excitement, run up the street and brush past them.  Then
    more people.  FERNANDO sits up straight.  The noise grows,
    rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.

    Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside
    the cathedral.  Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS
    tries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens
    in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:  in the
    center of the square stand three pyres, already alit.
    HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.

                    FERNANDO
            Look, Father!

    Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the
    mule and into the crowd.   

                    COLUMBUS
            Fernando!

    But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people.
    COLUMBUS tries to follow him.  Flames leap into the night
    sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with
    a lurid glow.  Prayers are being chanted somewhere.

    FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.

    A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a
    MAN bound to a post.  The heretic wears the "sambenito", a
    robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been
    crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs,
    indicating that the man is Jewish.

    THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear.  But he refuses to kiss
    the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.

    FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't
    realize what is happening.  He is too close to the
    platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.

                    COLUMBUS
            Fernando!

    He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him
    away from the scene.  But FERNANDO looks back.  The
    distance now allows him to see inside the flames.

    A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a
    silent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the
    head falls on one shoulder.  Then the whole body collapses
    into the fire.


    INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT

    COLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed,
    stone-floored hallway of the modest house.  FERNANDO is
    mute, shocked by what he just witnessed.  COLUMBUS takes
    the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother,
    BEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them.  She is a
    beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic
    personality.  COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair.  FERNANDO
    glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say
    anything.


    INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

    COLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is
    cooking.  He explains Fernando's subdued manner.

                    COLUMBUS
            Executions.  In the square.

    BEATRIX nods.  He goes to the stone butt and pours water
    on his hands.

                    COLUMBUS
            They've agreed to see me in a week.

    BEATRIX puts the candle on the table.  Her face lights up
    with a smile.  He walks to her, and kisses her.

                    COLUMBUS
            I could be gone for years.

                    BEATRIX
            I know.

                    COLUMBUS
            I haven't given you much of a life.

                    BEATRIX
                (amused)
            Well... that's true.  I have a child
            by a man who won't marry me!  Who's
            always leaving...

                    COLUMBUS
            Are we going to argue?

                    BEATRIX
            I'd love to argue with you
            sometimes.  But you're never here!

    They laugh and kiss.

                    COLUMBUS
            Perhaps I was never meant to live
            with a woman...

                    BEATRIX
                (still kissing him)
            I find that hard to believe.

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

    INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

    They are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is
    unusually silent and thoughtful.  COLUMBUS pours a little
    wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.  FERNANDO
    looks up at him, surprised.  COLUMBUS smiles, then looks
    over at BEATRIX.

                    COLUMBUS
            Fernando, don't you think we are
            lucky to live with such a beautiful
            woman?

    He winks at FERNANDO.  BEATRIX smiles.


    INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

    The room is dark.  As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a
    candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX.  BEATRIX
    looks up at him intently.  A drop of wax falls on her
    skin.  She flinches, murmurs...

    They make love.


    EXT.  SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY

    A medieval "campus".  Students-novices are playing
    "pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball.  They run
    with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing
    white legs.  Others are studying, reading, hurrying to
    their class.

    We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above
    the court.  Others are waiting with him.  A MONK comes
    from a door, and looks around the group.

                    MONK
                (hesitant)
            Christopher Columbus?


    INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

    An El Greco painting.  A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on
    dark, sculpted seats.  Candles throw a gloomy light on
    their faces.  Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in
    bourgeois outfits.

    Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish
    fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of
    Aragon.  A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory
    claw at the top.  Languidly, he scratches his back -- his
    off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his
    peers.

                    AROJAZ
            You say Asia can be found by sailing
            west?

                    COLUMBUS
            Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage
            should not take more than six or
            seven weeks.

                    AROJAZ
            Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is
            precisely where our opinions
            differ...
                (pause)
            Are you familiar with the work of
            Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?

                    COLUMBUS
            I am, Your Eminence

                    AROJAZ
            Then you cannot ignore that
            according to their calculations, the
            circumference of the Earth is
            approximately...
                (he leans forward)
            22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes
            the ocean... uncrossable.

    He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.

                    AROJAZ
            But you may have found new evidence
            proving that these men of knowledge
            are totally mistaken!

    A ripple of mirthless laughter.

                    COLUMBUS
            Your Excellencies are aware of the
            statements of Marin de Tyr?

                    HERNANDO DE TALAVERA
            We are.

                    COLUMBUS
            Then you are also aware that his
            theories contradict Ptolemeus... De
            Tyr believes the Ocean to be only
            750 leagues...

    A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the
    Commission.  But Columbus is determined to press his
    theories.

                    COLUMBUS
            The Florentine Toscanelli and the
            French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both
            think that Marin de Tyr is accurate
            in his calculations.  And therefore,
            that the ocean can be crossed.

    Indignant and amused murmurs.  DIEGO DE DEZA raises his
    voice to quiet the assembly.

                    DIEGO DE DEZA
            Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de
            Tyr is right...
                (the laughter
                subsides)
            Are we here to examine this proposal
            or not?

    Silence.

                    DIEGO DE DEZA
                (to Columbus)
            In your opinion, how long would the
            voyage be?

                    COLUMBUS
            Seven weeks.  Six, during the summer
            months.

    The murmur increases.

                    AROJAZ
            Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has
            been corrected many times over the
            centuries by the finest geographers.
            Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a
            year!

    A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as
    being a seaman, interrupts.

                    VICUNA
            How would the crew survive without
            being able to land for fresh water?
            Water is undrinkable after six
            weeks!  You'd never be able to turn
            back!

                    COLUMBUS
            We wouldn't have to turn back!  We
            would find land at this point!

                    AROJAZ
            Senor Colon, an experienced captain
            such as yourself will understand our
            concern with the crew.  I am not
            willing to have on my conscience the
            loss of men who would have relied
            upon our judgment.

                    COLUMBUS
            Excellency, you are right.

    Instantly, the protests stop.

                    COLUMBUS
            I am a seaman, not a scholar... But
            as a simple man craving for
            knowledge, I have read all the work
            of these renowned geographers and
            discovered that none of them could
            agree on the exact width of this
            ocean...

    He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as
    a lawyer before a grand jury.

                    COLUMBUS
            Therefore, as a modest man, I
            wonder:  who is right?

    The experts listen.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ'S FACE, impressed by
    the boldness.

                    COLUMBUS
            Who is right?  This question remains
            unanswered.

    He walks and stops before TALAVERA, and catches the look
    of SANCHEZ, sitting just behind him.

                    COLUMBUS
            Your Eminence, there is only one way
            to settle the matter.  And that is
            to make the journey.
                (to the assembly,
                with passion)
            I am ready to risk my life to prove
            it possible.

                    AROJAZ
            Your life, and that of others!

                    COLUMBUS
            If they agree to follow me, yes.

                    SANCHEZ (O.S.)
            Suppose you cross this ocean.
            Suppose you reach Asia.  What would
            Spain do there?

    Conscious of a friendlier voice, COLUMBUS sees the
    Treasurer SANCHEZ, an imposing man in his fifties.

                    COLUMBUS
            Trade, Your Excellency.  According
            to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China
            is one of the richest of the world.
            Even the meanest buildings are
            roofed with gold.

                    AROJAZ
                (interrupting)
            Is that all that interests you?
            Gold?

                    COLUMBUS
            No.  The Portuguese have already
            discovered black-skinned people.  I,
            too, will find other populations --
            and bring them to the word of God.

    THE MONK smiles thinly.

                    AROJAZ
            Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the
            Bearer of the Cross!

                    MONK
                (ironic)
            And Colon -- the one who populates!

    Another small rill of laughter.

                    AROJAZ
            If God intended our proximity to
            Asia, do you believe he would have
            waited for you to show it to the
            world?

                    COLUMBUS
            Did He not choose a carpenter's son
            to reveal Himself to the world?

    A hum of interest.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ -- watching COLUMBUS
    intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.

                    AROJAZ
            So you consider yourself the chosen
            one?

    A pause.

                    AROJAZ
            Don't you realize your words could
            be considered heretical?

                    COLUMBUS
                (calmly)
            Blind faith is what I consider
            heresy!

    The murmur turns to an audible gasp.  AROJAZ gets to his
    feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a
    candle only inches from his face.

    There is absolute silence.  COLUMBUS meets the MONK'S gaze
    unflinchingly.

                    COLUMBUS
                (quietly)
            Asia can be found to the west -- and
            I will prove it.

                    AROJAZ
            IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!


    EXT.  TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAY

    The JURY is alone to deliberate.  Food and wine has been
    laid out on tables.  In the distance, students' cries
    carry over the conversation.

    SANCHEZ approaches.

                    AROJAZ
            The Treasurer of Spain honors us
            with his presence.

    SANCHEZ bows slightly.

                    SANCHEZ
            The State has some reason to be
            interested in this man's
            proposition, Your Eminence...

                    AROJAZ
            The Judgment is ours!

                    SANCHEZ
            Naturally.  But I would really
            deplore the loss of such a potential
            opportunity for Spain for a...
            dispute over a point of geography.

    SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the
    other members of the committee, who pretend not to be
    listening.

                    AROJAZ
                (interrupting)
            He is a mercenary!  Did he not
            already try to convince the King of
            Portugal of his absurd notions?

                    SANCHEZ
            Indeed.  The world is full of
            mercenaries -- and states often make
            use of them, when it benefits them.
                (casually)
            My only concern is the welfare and
            prosperity of Spain.

    AROJAZ understands the hint, and stops smiling.

                    AROJAZ
            You would use your influence to
            assist this... intriguer?

    SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry.

                    SANCHEZ
            You know, Your Eminence, the
            fascinating thing about power, is
            that what can be given so
            effortlessly...

    He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts
    his glass.  But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter,
    pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table,
    leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass.

                    SANCHEZ
            ... can so easily be taken away.

    And he drinks with a smile.


    INT.  LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENING

    MARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter.

                    MARCHENA
            ... and therefore nothing could
            justify the participation of Your
            Highnesses in the venture that
            relies upon such feeble assumptions,
            and which any man of knowledge
            would take to be impractical... if
            not impossible.

    He shakes his head, puts the letter down.  COLUMBUS looks
    appalled; devastated.

                    COLUMBUS
            They didn't listen.  They didn't
            want to listen!

    He paces about the book-lined room.

                    MARCHENA
            You mustn't give way to despair.
            You must wait.

                    COLUMBUS
            Wait!  I've waited seven years
            already!  How much longer do you
            want me to wait?

                    MARCHENA
            If God intends you to go, then you
            will go.

                    COLUMBUS
                (angrily)
            Damn God!

    MARCHENA is shocked.

                    MARCHENA
            Colon!

                    COLUMBUS
            Damn all of you!  You all set up
            theories based on what?  You never
            leave the safety of your studies!
            Go out!  Find out what the world is
            about and then tell me something I
            can listen to!

    He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.

                    COLUMBUS
            These don't mean anything!  They're
            full of assumptions!  Out of the
            heads of old men who've never been
            past the end of their gardens!

    He hurls the book across the room.  MARCHENA is horrified.

                    MARCHENA
            No...!  My books...!

    COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping
    them to the floor.

                    COLUMBUS
            All of them!  Just lies!

                    MARCHENA
            Colon!  Don't!

    MARCHENA tries to stop him.  In his fury, COLUMBUS
    accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground.  His
    cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room.

    As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books
    everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this
    big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect.  Finally, a
    short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends
    COLUMBUS crashing to the floor.


    INT.  CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING

    COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor.  He is dressed
    in a homespun robe.  His arms are stretched out in
    penance.  FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him.

                    FERNANDO
            Father?

                    DIEGO
            Sssshhhh...!  One can't speak to a
            man doing penance.

                    FERNANDO
            What can you do?

                    DIEGO
            Nothing.  That's the point,
            Fernando.

    A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor
    beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same
    way.  DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to
    join them.


    EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

    Along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry
    in the light breeze.  COLUMBUS pins up a new addition.
    Another MONK works nearby, in silence.

                    PINZON (O.S.)
            Senor Colon?

    COLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching:  a
    middle-class gentleman.  He nods.

                    PINZON
            Ah, thank God!  I've been looking
            all over Seville for you!  Never
            expected to find a sailor in a
            monastery, eh?

    He laughs.  COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything.
    PINZON is clearly a little surprised.

                    PINZON
            Name's Pinzon, by the way.  Martin
            Alonzo Pinzon.  I'm a ship owner
            from Palos...

    COLUMBUS glances around cautiously, and walks a little way
    down the cloister, away from the other MONK, gesturing for
    PINZON to follow him.  PINZON is yet more surprised by
    this strange behavior.

                    PINZON
                (indicating the
                monk)
            Is he a spy?

    COLUMBUS shakes his head.  PINZON stares at him,
    perplexed.

                    PINZON
            What is it?  Are you a Trappist?

    COLUMBUS shakes his head again.

                    PINZON
            Vow of silence...?  Penance?

    COLUMBUS nods vigorously.

                    PINZON
            Jesus!  Just my luck!

    He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk
    cloth.

                    PINZON
            Listen.  I'll do the talking for
            both of us.  You just nod.  Agreed?
            Just as I do with the wife.

    COLUMBUS nods.

                    PINZON
            I know that the Commission turned
            you down, right?  What do you
            expect?  You're a foreigner... But I
            want to help you.

    COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in
    the air.

                    PINZON
            You wonder why I believe in you?
            Hey, I am a seaman.  And we don't
            like to be told where to go, and
            where not to go.

    COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing.  The other
    MONK looks round severely.  COLUMBUS ducks behind a map,
    PINZON following him.  PINZON lowers his voice.

                    PINZON
            I don't look like it, but I have
            friends at the Court.  The Treasurer
            of Aragon, for example.  He finances
            me.  His name's Santangel.  Ever
            heard of him?

    COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly
    interested by what he's hearing.

                    PINZON
            He can get you an audience with the
            Queen!  You know why...?  She owes
            him money.  That's how it is.  You
            -- me -- the Queen -- the world and
            his mistress -- agreed?

    COLUMBUS nods.

                    PINZON
            So.  What do you say?

    COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of
    the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:

                    COLUMBUS
            Where can I meet this man?

                    PINZON
                (indicating with a
                nod)
            Immediately.

    COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties,
    examining the maps.


    EXT.  STREETS OF GRANADA - DAY

    A huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret
    of a mosque.  SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the
    foot of the tower.  To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a
    Cross is hoisted up in its place... Astride horses,
    COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the
    scene.

    They push through an extraordinary scene.  The city of
    Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after
    several years of siege.  All around them, SPANISH SOLDIERS
    are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS,
    bearing only a few possessions.  Ragged, half-starved men,
    women and children.

                    SANTANGEL
            These people built Granada...
            Centuries ago!  It is a great
            victory over the Moors, Don Colon --
            and yet what a tragedy it is!

    The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful
    PENITENTS, who are crawling on their knees, chanting
    psalms and flagellating themselves.  At the head of the
    procession, HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin
    Mary swathed in silk and lace.

    The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight.

                    COLUMBUS
            Is this a good time to meet her?

                    SANTANGEL
            It couldn't be better.  Victors
            can't say no.

    Bells are pealing triumphantly.  The noise is tumultuous.
    They ride towards the magnificent palace.


    EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

    Fabulous Moorish gardens:  ponds filled with golden carp;
    exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... The distant
    sounds of victory.

    SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens, escorted
    by HALBERDIERS.  SOLDIERS pass by, carrying coffers or
    piles of documents.

    As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are
    fewer people.  They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where
    several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience.

    SANCHEZ appears.  They bow.  SANTANGEL approaches to
    murmur a compliment.

                    SANTANGEL
            Your Excellency... truly grateful...
            your help... as ever...

    SANCHEZ protests softly, and looks over at COLUMBUS, a
    half-smile forming on his lips.  Then a DUENA appears, and
    motions for COLUMBUS to follow.


    INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

    An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand.
    We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades,
    mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of
    Granada's rooftops.

    Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of
    QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN.  The light in her blonde hair
    creates a halo around her head as she turns.  COLUMBUS
    falls to his knees.

                    ISABEL
            Rise...!  Come forward!

    He approaches the window, stopping close to her.  ISABEL
    scrutinizes him quickly.

                    ISABEL
            I should not even be listening to
            you, since my council said no.  But
            Santangel tells me you are a man of
            honor and sincerity... And Sanchez,
            that you are not a fool.

                    COLUMBUS
                (bold)
            No more than the woman who said she
            would take Granada from the Moors.

    ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.

                    ISABEL
            The ocean is uncrossable?

                    COLUMBUS
            What did they say about Granada
            before today?

                    ISABEL
                (a beat)
            That she was impregnable.

    ISABEL smiles again.

                    ISABEL
            I cannot ignore the verdict of my
            council.

                    COLUMBUS
            Surely you can do anything you want.

    A direct challenge.  She doesn't know what to make of this
    man.

                    ISABEL
            How little you know.

    This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their
    positions for a moment.  Now we sense COLUMBUS
    scrutinizing her.

                    COLUMBUS
            May I speak freely?

                    ISABEL
                (with a smile)
            You show no inclination to speak
            otherwise!

                    COLUMBUS
            I know what I see.  I see someone
            who doesn't accept the world as it
            is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a
            women who thinks... "What if?"...

                    ISABEL
                (amused at his
                familiarity)
            A woman?

    A slight pause.

                    COLUMBUS
            Forgive me... but you're the only
            Queen I know.

    She bursts out laughing.

                    ISABEL
            Then we are equal... since you are
            the only sailor I know!

    A beat.

                    ISABEL
            How old are you, Senor Colon?

                    COLUMBUS
            Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And
            you?

    Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away
    slightly to hide it.

                    ISABEL
            Thirty eight...

    A pause.

                    ISABEL
            You will be informed of our
            decision.

    COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave.  As the DUENA opens the
    door for him, he turns back.

                    COLUMBUS
            Actually, I thought you were younger
            than me!

    And he goes out, leaving her stunned.


    EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY

    A chalk white road, lined with trees.  Two liveried
    SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large
    silver tray, the other a smaller tray.

    They are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along
    the road, with documents under his arm.


    EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAY

    The CLERK enters an imposing stable block.

    In the paddock, SANCHEZ is training a magnificent young
    horse, making it step sideways, bending it to his will.
    The ADMINISTRATOR watches him, unable to interrupt.

    Behind him the two SERVANTS can be seen bringing in the
    silver trays, with covered dishes of food, a decanter of
    wine.  They begin to lay them out on a table.


    EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - LATER

    SANCHEZ pours himself some wine, tucks into his his food,
    while the ADMINISTRATOR, clearly working himself up into a
    frenzy, reads from a document.

                    ADMINISTRATOR
            ... and he demands... he DEMANDS to
            be made a Knight, with the right to
            bear the Golden Spurs!  He will
            receive the title of Don Cristobal
            Colon -- which will be extended to
            his descendants for ever more...

    The ADMINISTRATOR looks up.  He is reading the contract
    that COLUMBUS has proposed.  SANCHEZ, his mouth full,
    gestures for him to continue.

                    SANCHEZ
            Go on!

                    ADMINISTRATOR
            He will be named Great Admiral of
            the Ocean Sea.  Viceroy of the West
            Indies... Governor of all islands or
            lands discovered or as will be
            discovered with his help...

    The ADMINISTRATOR looks up again.

                    ADMINISTRATOR
            The highest titles of nobility, Your
            Excellency!  To an immigrant
            sheltered by monks!

    SANCHEZ gestures for the document.  Wipes his mouth.
    Continues reading, calmly:

                    SANCHEZ
            Furthermore he will receive one
            eight of all wealth or monies,
            precious gems, pearls, metals,
            spices and other lucrative sources
            conquered within the boundaries of
            his admiralty...

    He smiles, hands the document back.

                    SANCHEZ
            It's very underdone.

                    ADMINISTRATOR
                (exploding)
            Underdone!  It's monstrous,
            Excellency!

                    SANCHEZ
            No, the pheasant.  It's almost raw.

    And he carries on eating.

                    SANCHEZ
            You worry too much, Carvajal... The
            man will have to lower his demands.
            Believe me, he WILL!


    INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

    Close up on COLUMBUS.

                    COLUMBUS
            I WON'T!

    A WOMAN'S HAND quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy
    hole in the wall.  Two beautiful eyes peer through a
    grille, into the next room.

    What they see:

    SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together.  COLUMBUS is visibly upset.

                    SANCHEZ
                (calmly)
            We have considered your -- demands
            very carefully, Senor Colon... Your
            expectations are... excessive, in
            every way.

    COLUMBUS tightens his fists, tries to remain calm.

                    COLUMBUS
            If I am right, my requests are fair!

    SANCHEZ holds up a document.

                    SANCHEZ
            We have prepared our own contract...

    He offers the document to COLUMBUS, who takes it, scans it
    quickly, shakes his head.

                    COLUMBUS
            No...

                    SANCHEZ
            No?

                    COLUMBUS
            NO...!  I have waited too long,
            fought too hard.  Now you expect me
            to take all the risks while you take
            the profit!  No... I will not be
            your servant!

    The eyes behind the screen -- the mouth, forming a little
    smile.

                    SANCHEZ
            I remind you, Senor Colon, that you
            are in no position to bargain with
            me.

                    COLUMBUS
            I'm not bargaining!

                    SANCHEZ
                (steely)
            Then you are too ambitious.

    COLUMBUS leans over the table, faces him.

                    COLUMBUS
            And were you never ambitious,
            Excellency?  Or is ambition only a
            virtue among the nobles, a fault for
            the rest of us?

                    SANCHEZ
                (abrupt)
            If you won't accept our proposal,
            we'll simply find someone who will.

    COLUMBUS smiles.

                    COLUMBUS
            If you can do that, Excellency --
            I'll become a monk!

    He turns, strides towards the door.  We hear a WOMAN'S
    muffled laughter.

    As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret
    door.  SANCHEZ bows.

    ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out.

                    ISABEL
            You were right, Don Sanchez... His
            demands could never be granted.

                    SANCHEZ
            Never, Your Majesty.  Although...

    She turns, questioningly, towards him.

                    SANCHEZ
            ... Although one may always
            renegotiate a contract.  Especially
            signed by Royal Hands.


    EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE GARDENS - POV - DAY

    SANCHEZ joins ISABEL at the window.  They see COLUMBUS
    striding out and away.


    INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

    BACK TO SANCHEZ

                    SANCHEZ
                (quietly)
            ... Into a monk...

                    ISABEL
                (with a smile)
            Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't
            it?
                (turning to Sanchez)
            Call him back!


    EXT.  STREET - EVENING   

    Teeming life.  COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds.
    He is expressionless and distracted.

    He looks around him, stops walking.  And then,
    unexpectedly, shouts.

                    COLUMBUS
            YEEEEEEES!

    All heads turn as if he were totally insane.  He walks on
    as if nothing happened.


    INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

    COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with
    a glass of wine.  There is a movement behind him.  BEATRIX
    is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt.

    COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad.

                    COLUMBUS
            She said yes.

                    BEATRIX
                (moved)
            Thank God...

    She smiles.  But he seems to be unable to share her
    happiness.

                    COLUMBUS
            If I ever come back, I swear I
            will...

    She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his
    mouth.

                    BEATRIX
                (softly)
            I'm not asking you to swear to
            anything.

                    COLUMBUS
            I don't want you to wait for me.

                    BEATRIX
                (smiling)
            That's something you can't decide.

    COLUMBUS kisses her.


    INT.  CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

    Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark
    tunnel.  FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks
    slowly down the dark corridor.

    Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study.


    INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT

    CLOSE ON:  A huge illustrated map of western Europe and
    Asia.  FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic
    Ocean, to the edge of the map.  There, the illustrator's
    imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons;
    creatures half-human, half-animal.

    Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.

                    FERNANDO (O.S.)
            You can't go there!

    Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him.

                    COLUMBUS
            Why not?

    FERNANDO points at the monsters.  He pulls the boy to him.

                    COLUMBUS
            There aren't any monsters, Fernando.
            The only monsters are in here...
                (he taps his own
                forehead)
            Watch!

    He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible
    monsters, transforming it at once.  FERNANDO laughs
    immediately.

                    FERNANDO
            I want to go with you!

                    COLUMBUS
            There'll be a time.

                    FERNANDO
            You promise?
                (Columbus nods his
                head)
            Do you swear on St. Christopher...?

    FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St. Christopher medal
    from under COLUMBUS' shirt.

                    FERNANDO
            Do you swear on all the Holy Saints
            in heaven?

                    COLUMBUS
                (laughing)
            Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!

    And he hugs his SON tightly.


    EXT.  HILLSIDE AND GATE - PRE-DAWN

    A luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate,
    down to the harbor.  We see the faces of the SAILORS and
    their FAMILIES -- COLUMBUS, PINZON AMONGST THEM -- We
    sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure.  The
    procession is lead by MARCHENA and four young NOVICES
    carrying the Madonna.  All hold long, burning tapers,
    saying the rosary.  A SAILOR pushes through the crowd, and
    kisses the Madonna's feet.


    EXT.  PALOS HARBOR - DAWN

    Hundreds of candles flicker in the pre-dawn light, held by
    the FAMILIES and FRIENDS of the SAILORS.

    The SANTA MARIA the PINTA and the NINA nestle against the
    quayside.  Dwarfed by the hulls, a flotilla of smaller
    fishing craft, returning from night fishing, accidentally
    witness this event.


    EXT.  MAKESHIFT CONFESSIONAL - DOCKSIDE - DAWN

    MARCHENA sits on a barrel and crosses himself.  Behind a
    curtain sits COLUMBUS.

                    MARCHENA
            In Nomine Patris et Filius, et
            Spiritus Sancti.

                    COLUMBUS
            Forgive me, Father.  For I have
            sinned.

    MARCHENA recognizes COLUMBUS' voice.

                    MARCHENA
            I am listening, my son.

                    COLUMBUS
            Father, I have betrayed my family.
            I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed
            you.

                    MARCHENA
            What are you saying?

                    COLUMBUS
            I lied.  The journey will be longer
            than I said.

                    MARCHENA
            How long?

                    COLUMBUS
            I am not sure... It could be twice
            the distance.

    A pause.

                    MARCHENA
            May God forgive you...!  You must
            tell them!  You must tell your men!

                    COLUMBUS
            If I tell them, they won't follow
            me.  You know that I am right,
            Father.  You trust me...

                    MARCHENA
            My son, my son...
                (he shakes his head)
            Your certitudes are sometimes
            frightening...
                (pause)
            Christopher, you must speak to them.
            And if you don't I will.

                    COLUMBUS
            You are bound by an oath, Father.

    A long silence.

                    MARCHENA
            I believed in you...

                    COLUMBUS
            Give me absolution.

    No response.

                    COLUMBUS
            Give me absolution, Father!

    Devastated, MARCHENA reluctantly makes the sign of the
    cross.


    EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - PALOS - DAWN

    COLUMBUS walks over to where BEATRIX and FERNANDO are
    waiting.  He kisses and hugs FERNANDO.

                    MARCHENA (O.S.)
            Ispo Te Absoluto.  May God forgive
            you and have mercy on your soul,
            Christopher Columbus.  Go in peace.

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

    EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - DAWN - LATER

    The CROWDED QUAYSIDE.  COLUMBUS stands in front of
    FERNANDO.

                    COLUMBUS
            Be good to your mother, Fernando.
            Do you promise?

    FERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes.  Then COLUMBUS embraces
    BEATRIX tightly.  She whispers into his ear.

                    BEATRIX
            Speak to Diego.

    But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and
    instead they clumsily hug.  Someone taps COLUMBUS'
    shoulder.  He turns around to see SANTANGEL.  Wordlessly,
    they hug.

                                    CUT TO:

    Activity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes
    fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water... Now
    the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside.  The
    CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS.  WOMEN
    holding up babies, blowing kisses, old PARENTS crying...
    BEATRIX, HER SONS, AND SANTANGEL are among them.

    COLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and
    throws it at DIEGO.

                    COLUMBUS
            Diego!  Here!

    DIEGO catches it.  Opening his hand he looks at the
    medallion.  Then looks up at his FATHER, elated.

    THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY.
    SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS.

                    SANTANGEL
                (casually)
            Take care of my investment, wherever
            you're going!

                    COLUMBUS
                (ambiguous)
            I have to tell you Santangel.  I
            don't know where on earth I am
            going!

    They both laugh.

    A FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand
    slide gently along the gigantic hull.  He stares up at the
    SAILORS leaning on the rail.

                    SAILOR
            Vaya con Dios!  (Go with God!)

    They wave back.

                                    CUT TO:

    MARCHENA walking towards the Moorish gate.  He finally
    turns, sad and distraught.  He sees:

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY

    THREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN.

    The sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath.
    A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable
    metamorphosis.  Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety
    of the crew, the fear of the unknown...

    ENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging
    majestically through the waves.  Sinking back,
    disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music.


    EXT.  DECK - DAY

    A SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck.

    A SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast.

    A COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of
    the evening meal.

    TEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail,
    punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - NIGHT

    The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an
    instrument.

    COLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the
    prow.  Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars.

    SOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity.  One of them is
    ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque.

    Near COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts.  He
    makes an entry in the log.  Then goes back to his
    quadrant.  He senses MENDEZ standing next to him.

                    COLUMBUS
                (softly)
            Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may
            God be with us...

                    MENDEZ
            God be with us admiral.

    MENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS.

                    COLUMBUS
            What is it Mendez?  Speak!

    MENDEZ is hesitant.  He nervously clears his throat.

                    MENDEZ
            Well... It's the men, Sir.  They
            wonder how you know our position.
            We've lost sight from land days
            ago...

                    COLUMBUS
                (still taking
                readings)
            And what do you think Mendez?

                    MENDEZ
            Well, I surely know what a quadrant
            is!  But I've never seen it used at
            night before.

                    COLUMBUS
            Come over here.

    MENDEZ hesitates, then motions to COLUMBUS.  The SAILORS
    are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation.

                    COLUMBUS
            Now, find the North Star.  Do you
            have it?

                                    CUT TO:

    The picture swims across the heavens, until we see the
    north star.

                    COLUMBUS (O.S.)
            Steady yourself...!  Keep the plumb
            line vertical...

    The picture steadies.

                                    CUT TO:

    MENDEZ nods -- and loses equilibrium.  The plumb line
    swings.

                    COLUMBUS
            Don't move!  A mistake of one degree
            and we'll be off 6,000 leagues!

    MENDEZ tries again.

                    COLUMBUS
            What do you read?

                    MENDEZ
            Twenty eight.

    MENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS.

                    COLUMBUS
            That's it.  The twenty eighth
            parallel.  And we'll follow it until
            we reach land.

    ALONSO does not seem convinced.

                    ALONSO
            How do you know land is on the
            twenty eighth parallel?


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

    A blazing sun.  The ship is like a furnace, its brass
    fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the
    air shimmer over the decks.

    Desperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the
    sagging prow sail.

    The SHIP'S BOY throws an empty bucket attached to a rope
    over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with
    water.  As he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair
    lip.  He drenches himself... From the shade, ALONSO
    watches him.

                    ALONSO
            Chicken-ass face!

    The others laugh.  The BOY, ashamed, tries to ignore them.
    ALONSO'S hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he
    reacts like he was burnt.

                    ALONSO
            Shit!

    He sucks his blistered fingers.

                    ALONSO
            I never seen heat like this!  Not
            even in Las Minas!

                    SAILOR
            The water's going putrid in the
            barrels.

                    ALONSO
            You'll be drinking your own piss...
            For the glory of Spain... and
            Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!

    The SHIP'S BOY glances round at them.

                    ALONSO
            What are you listening to, chicken
            ass?

                    SAILOR
            Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no
            harm.

                    ALONSO
            With a face like that?
                (to boy)
            I don't want you looking at me.  You
            hear?

    The BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.

                    ALONSO
            He's the devil's child...

                    SAILOR
            We'll all go crazy...

    The BOY throws more water over the deck.  A SAILOR takes
    his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song.

                    SAILOR
            Culo de galina es el hijo del
            demonio... (Chicken ass mouth is the
            devil's child... Born from the loins
            of a stinky old goat etc...)

    They all laugh.  The BOY, hearing this, climbs to the
    crow's-nest like a monkey.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - RIGGING AND CROW'S-NEST - DAY

    We experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the
    main mast, high above the rolling deck.

    The BOY curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's-nest,
    exhausted by the heat, and scared.  His eyes are turning
    white.  He begins to piss himself...

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

    Piss is dripping on the deck.  THE SAILORS do not seem to
    care.  THE COOK takes a chicken from a cage.  He breaks
    its neck, and starts plucking it.  The OTHERS continue
    their bitter conversation.

                    ALONSO
            We should have seen land.

                    SAILOR
            We left three weeks ago, Alonso.
            Can't be that near.

                    ALONSO
            Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I
            don't like the smell of the sea
            around here.  Smells like a cunt.
            Bad sign...

    The COOK starts laughing.  They turn to him.

                    COOK
                (shaking his head)
            Of course it smells like it!  That's
            why sailors take to the sea!

    They all laugh.  Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on
    the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the
    land to appear.

                    ALONSO
            And why does this one take to the
            sea?  Nobody knows.  Never says a
            word...

    MENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect.  He
    approaches them.

                    MENDEZ
            To your post!  At once!

    They split in silence.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

    The SHIP is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind -- SAILORS
    sleep on deck.

    The SHIP'S BOY is singing to himself.  Despite his hair
    lip he has a pure, melancholy voice...

    COLUMBUS, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears
    it carry over the darkness.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

    CLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS, nearly through its time.

    The SHIP'S BOY throws an "ampoulette" over board.  We
    follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full
    length of the hull.  As it reaches the poop deck, another
    SAILOR shouts "MARK".  A very primitive system of
    calculation for distance and speed.

    Sitting near the SHIP'S BOY, COLUMBUS is making entries in
    a log-book, watching the hourglass.

                    SHIP'S BOY
            Mark.  Twenty nine, Sir!

    THE HOUR-GLASS runs out.  COLUMBUS converts the mark into
    a daily average for distance and speed.

                    COLUMBUS
            Six hundred and twenty nine.

    THE SHIP'S BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout.

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  PINTA - DAY

    PINZON, his OFFICERS beside him, looks across at the SANTA
    MARIA.

                    SHIP'S BOY
            Six hundred and twenty nine!

    AN OFFICER turns to PINZON to repeat the message.

                    OFFICER
            Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir!

    PINZON does not seem too pleased.

                    PINZON
            I heard.

    THE OFFICER examines his own calculations.

                    OFFICER
            Captain, I don't understand.

                    PINZON
            I think I do.

    He goes back to his cabin.

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  SHIPS - SARGASSO SEA - DAY

    ABSOLUTE STILLNESS.  A FURNACE.  The three ships like
    dots, on what seems to be a prairie of weed.

    The caravels are being towed by three rowing boats.

    CLOSE ON THE MEN, rowing, drenched with sweat.

    FROM THE PROW, COLUMBUS is staring at the horizon.

    ALONSO pulling at his oars stares at COLUMBUS' distant
    figure with hate and resentment.

    ALONSO suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat
    into disarray.  Chaos.

    Total silence.  MENDEZ and ALONSO stare at each other.

                    MENDEZ
            Continue rowing!

                    ALONSO
            To where?

    ALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ.  He then starts to beat
    a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the
    others.  In the two other boats, the MEN begin to follow
    suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls.

    MENDEZ looks up to COLUMBUS, in panic.

    ON BOARD PINZON'S SHIP, an OFFICER cups his hands to his
    mouth.

                    OFFICER
            Captain Pinzon requests permission
            to board.

                                    CUT TO:

    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DAY

                    COLUMBUS
            Granted.


    INT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - DAY

    PINZON enters.  He looks furious.

                    PINZON
            You lied!  You cheated!  We're way
            past 750 leagues!

                    COLUMBUS
                (calmly)
            Six days ago, yes.

                    PINZON
            You must be mad...!

                    COLUMBUS
            We have to keep the hopes of these
            men alive!

                    PINZON
            We're on the verge of a mutiny,
            Colon!

                    COLUMBUS
            You think I don't know that?

                    PINZON
            We're lost!

                    COLUMBUS
            The land is there.  I know it!

                    PINZON
            You don't know anything!  Listen
            Colon, these are my ships, right?
            So I'm telling you we're turning
            back!

                    COLUMBUS
            And then what?  Half of the water
            has gone, the rest is nearly putrid!
            You know that!

                    PINZON
                (apoplectic)
            Jesus Maria!  I should have never
            listened to you!

                    COLUMBUS
            You never did.  You did all the
            talking for both of us, remember?

                    PINZON
            You bloody...

                    COLUMBUS
            Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now
            is go forward!  Think about that!

                    PINZON
            You tell that to them!

                    COLUMBUS
            You're right.  Let the men decide.

    COLUMBUS moves to the door.  As an afterthought, he takes
    his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

    Most of the men are now back on board.

    They go silent as COLUMBUS appears.  He walks slowly over
    to them.  All, including ALONSO, are surly, threatening...

                    COLUMBUS
            Who gave you the order to come on
            board?

    He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO.  They
    stare at one another.

                    ALONSO
            God doesn't want us to cross the
            ocean...!  This voyage is cursed!

    Some of the MEN murmur their agreement.

                    COLUMBUS
            Cursed?

                    ALONSO
            We set sail for greed.  God has
            abandoned us.  The voyage is cursed.
            There are signs...

    ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip.
    The BOY lowers his eyes.  COLUMBUS moves towards him,
    pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.

                    COLUMBUS
            This boy has the voice of an angel.
            What comes out of his mouth is
            blessed, Alonso.  What comes out of
            your is evil.

    Some of the men laugh at this statement.  ALONSO is ill at
    ease.  COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN.

                    COLUMBUS
            Listen to me!  Every man is afraid
            who does something for the first
            time.  But those who overcome their
            fears, will find their rewards.  I
            do not know if it is God's will that
            we cross this ocean -- but I am
            certain it is the devil who puts
            fears into our hearts...

    The MEN are listening.  We sense a subtle change of
    mood...

                    COLUMBUS
            This jacket to the first man who
            sights land!  I want a man up that
            mast day and night.

    COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.

                    COLUMBUS
            You start first.

    The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast.  As he climbs, the
    mainsail starts to fill with wind.  The deck begins to
    move under their feet.

    This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly
    erase the fears and the angers.

                    MENDEZ
            Alonso!  Jaime!  Don't let this wind
            escape us.

    CRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut,
    filling with wind.  MEN rush to their posts.  PINZON
    stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief.

                    PINZON
                (murmuring)
            You lucky bastard...

    COLUMBUS walks away to his cabin, then turning back to
    PINZON.

                    COLUMBUS
            Pinzon, the more I sail, the luckier
            I get.

    Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin.


    EXT.  SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHT

    COLUMBUS is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his
    cape, struggling against the sleep.  MENDEZ approaches him
    with a bowl of soup.

                    MENDEZ
            Shall I take my turn?

    COLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the
    bowl.
