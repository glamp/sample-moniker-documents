All About Eve
FADE IN:

INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT

It is not a large room and jammed with tables, mostly for
four but some for six and eight. A long table of honor, for
about thirty people, has been placed upon a dais. 

Diner is over. Demi-tasses, cigars and brandy. The overall
effect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility. It is
June.

The CAMERA, as it has been throughout the CREDIT TITLES, is
on the SARAH SIDDONS AWARD. It is a gold statuette, about a
foot high, of Sarah Siddons as The Tragic Muse. Exquisitely
framed in a nest of flowers, it rests on a miniature altar in
the center of the table of honor. 

Over this we hear the crisp, cultured, precise VOICE of
ADDISON deWITT:

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 The Sarah Siddons Award for
Distinguished Achievement is
perhaps unknown to you. It has been
spared the sensational and
commercial publicity that attends
such questionable "honors" as the
Pulitzer Prize and those awards
presented annually by the film
society...

The CAMERA has EASED BACK to include some of the table of
honor and a distinguished gentleman with snow-white hair who
is speaking. We do not hear what he says. 

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 The distinguished looking gentleman
is an extremely old actor. Being an
actor - he will go on speaking for
some time. It is not important what
you hear what he says. 

The CAMERA EASES BACK some more, and CONTINUES until it
discloses a fairly COMPREHENSIVE SHOT of the room

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 However it is important that you
know where you are, and why you are
here. This is the dining room of
the Sarah Siddons Society.
The occasion is its annual banquet
and presentation of the highest
honor our Theater knows - the Sarah
Siddons Award for Distinguished
Achievement. 

A GROUP OF WAITERS are clustered near the screen masking the
entrances of the kitchen. The screens are papered with old
theatrical programs. The waiters are all aged and venerable.
They look respectfully toward the speaker. 

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 These hollowed walls, indeed many
of these faces, have looked upon
Modjeska, Ada Rehan and Minnie
Fiske; Mansfield's voice filled the
room, Booth breathed this air. It
is unlikely that the windows have
been opened since his death. 

CLOSE - THE AWARD on its altar, it shines proudly above five
or six smaller altars which surround it and which are now
empty. 

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 The minor awards, as you can see,
have already been presented. Minor
awards are for such as the writer
and director - since their function
is merely to construct a tower so
that the world can applaud a light
which flashes on top of it and no
brighter light has ever dazzled the
eye than Eve Harrington. Eve... but
more of Eve, later. All about Eve,
in fact.  

THE CAMERA MOVES TO: CLOSE - ADDISON deWITT, not young, not
unattractive, a fastidious dresser, sharp of eye and
merciless of tongue. An omnipresent cigarette holder projects
from his mouth like the sward of D'Artagnan. 

He sits back in his chair, musingly, his fingers making
little cannonballs out of bread crumbs. His narration covers
the MOVE of the CAMERA to him:

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 To those of you who do not read,
attend the Theater, listen to
uncensored radio programs or know
anything of the world in which we
live - it is perhaps necessary to
introduce myself. My name is
Addison deWitt.
My native habitat is the Theater -
in it I toil not, neither do I
spin. I am a critic and
commentator. I am essential to the
Theater - as ants are to a picnic,
as the ball weevil to a cotton
field... 

He looks to his left. KAREN RICHARDS is lovely and thirtyish
in an unprofessional way. She is scraping bread crumbs,
spilled sugar, etc., into a pile with a spoon. Addison takes
one of her bread crumbs. She smiles absently. Addison rolls
the bread crumb into a cannonball. 

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 This is Karen Richards. She is the
wife of a playwright, therefore of
the Theater by marriage. Nothing in
her background or breeding should
have brought her any closer the
stage than row E, center...

Karen continues her doodling. 

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 ... however, during her senior year
in Radcliffe, Lloyd Richards
lectured on drama. The following
year Karen became Mrs. Lloyd
Richards. Lloyd is the author of
'Footsteps on the Ceiling' - the
play which has won for Eve
Harrington the Sarah Siddons
Award...

Karen absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse. A
hand reaches in to take the spoon away. Karen looks as the
CAMERA PANS with IT to MAX FABIAN. He sits at her left. He's
a sad-faced man with glasses and a look of constant
apprehension. He smiles apologetically and indicated a white
powder with he unwraps. He pantomimes that his ulcer is
snapping.   

Karen smiles back, returns to her doodling. Addison mashes a
cigarette stub, pops it out of his holder. He eyes Max. 

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 There are two types of theatrical
producers. One has a great many
wealthy friends who will risk a tax
deductible loss. This type is
interested in Art. 

Max drops the powder into some water, stirs it, drinks, burps
delicately and close his eyes. 

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 The other is one to whom each
production mean potential ruin or
fortune. This type is out to make a
buck. Meet Max Fabian. He is the
producer of the play which has won
Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons
Award...

Max rests fitfully. He twitches. A hand reaches into the
SCENE, removes a bottle of Scotch from before him. The CAMERA
follows the bottle to MARGO CHANNING. She sits at Max's left,
at deWitt's right. An attractive, strong face. She is
childish, adult, reasonable, unreasonable - usually one when
she should be the other, but always positive. She pours a
stiff drink.   

Addison hold out the soda bottle to her. She looks at it, and
at him, as if it were a tarantula and he had gone mad. He
smiles and pours a glass of soda for himself. 

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 Margo Channing is the Star of the
Theater. She made her first stage
appearance, at the age of four, in
'Midsummer Night's Dream'. She
played a fairy and entered - quite
unexpectedly - stark naked. She has
been a Star ever since. 

Margo sloshes her drink around moodily, pulls at it.

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 Margo is a great Star. A true Star.
She never was or will be anything
less or anything less... 
(slight pause)
... the part for which Eve
Harrington is receiving the Sarah
Siddons Award was intended
originally for Margo Channing...

Addison, having sipped his soda water, puts a new cigarette
in his holder, leans back, lights it, looks and exhales in
the general direction of the table of honor. As he speaks the
CAMERA MOVES in the direction of his glance...

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 Having covered in tedious detail
not only the history of the Sarah
Siddons Society, but also the
history of acting since Thespis
first stepped out of the chorus
line - our distinguished chairman
has finally arrived at our reason
for being here...  

At this point Addison's voice FADES OUT and the voice of the
aged actor FADES IN. CAMERA is in MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT of him
and the podium. 

			AGED ACTOR
	 I have been proud and privileged to
have spent my life in the Theater -
"a poor player ... that struts and
frets his hour upon the stage" -
and I have been honored to be, for
forty years, Chief Promoter of the
Sarah Siddons Society...
(he lifts the Sarah
Siddons Award from its
altar)
Thirty-nine times have I placed in
deserving hands this highest honor
the Theater knows...
(he grows a bit arch, he
uses his eyebrows)
Surely no actor is older than I - I
have earned my place out of the
sun...
(indulgent laughter)
... and never before has this Award
gone to anyone younger than its
recipient tonight. How fitting that
it should pass from my hands to
hers...

EVE HANDS: Lovely, beautifully groomed. In serene repose,
they rest between a demi-tasse cup and an exquisite small
evening cup.  

			AGED ACTOR
	 Such young hands. Such a young
lady. Young in years, but whose
heart is as old as the Theater...

Addison's eyes narrow quizzically as he listens. Then,
slowly, he turns to look at Karen...

			AGED ACTOR
	 Some of us a privileged to know
her. We have seen beyond the beauty
and artistry- 

Karen never ceases her thoughtful pat-a-cake with the crumbs. 

			AGED ACTOR
	 -that have made her name resound
through the nation. We know her
humility. Her devotion, her loyalty
to her art. 

Addison's glance moves from Karen to Margo. 

			AGED ACTOR
	 Her love, her deep and abiding love
for us-

Margo's face is a mask. She looks down at the drink which she
cradles with both hands. 

			AGED ACTOR
	 -for what we are and what we do.
The Theater. She has had one wish,
one prayer, one dream. To belong to
us. 
(he's nearing his curtain
line)
Tonight her dream has come true.
And henceforth we shall dream the
same of her. 
(a slight pause)
Honored members, ladies and
gentlemen - for distinguished
achievement in the Theater - the
Sarah Siddons Award to Miss Eve
Harrington. 

The entire room is galvanized into sudden and tumultuous
applause. Some enthusiastic gentlemen rise to her feet...
Flash bulbs start popping about halfway down the table of the
Aged Actor's left... 

Eve rises - beautiful, radiant, poised, exquisitely gowned.
She stands in simple and dignified response to the ovation. 

A dozen photographers skip, squat, and dart about like water
bugs. Flash bulbs pop and pop and pop...

THE WAITERS applaud enthusiastically...

AGED ACTOR, Award in hand, he beams at her...

EVE smiles sweetly to her left, then to her right...

MAX has come to. He applauds lustily.

ADDISON's applauding too, more discreetly. 

MARGO, not applauding. But you sense no deliberate slight,
merely an impression that as she looks at Eve her mind is on
something else...

KAREN, nor is she applauding. But her gaze is similarly fixed
on Eve in a strange, faraway fashion. 

ADDISON, still applauding, his eyes flash first at Margo and
then at Karen. Then he directs them back to Eve. He smiles
ever so slightly.  

The applause has continued unabated. EVE turns now, and moves
gracefully toward the Aged Actor. She moves through
applauding ladies and gentlemen; from below the flash bulbs
keep popping... 

As she nears her goal, the Ages Actor turns to her. He holds
out the award. Her hand reaches out for it. At that precise
moment - with the award just beyond her fingertips - THE
PICTURE HOLDS, THE ACTION STOPS. The SOUND STOPS. 

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 Eve. Eve, the Golden Girl. The
cover girl, the girl next door, the
girl on the moon... Time has been
good to Eve, Life goes where she
goes - she's been profiled,
covered, revealed, reported, what
she eats and when and where, whom
she knows and where she was and
when and where she's going...   

ADDISON has stopped applauding, he's sitting forward, staring
intently at Eve... his narration continues unbroken.

			ADDISON'S VOICE
	 ... Eve. You all know all about
Eve... what can there be to know
that you don't know...?

As he leans back, the APPLAUSE FADES IN as tumultuous as
before. Addison's look moves slowly from Eve to Karen.  

KAREN, she leans forward now, her eyes intently on Eve. Her
lovely face FILLS THE SCREEN as the APPLAUSE FADES ONCE MORE -
as she thinks back:

			KAREN'S VOICE
	 When was it? How long? It seems a
lifetime ago. Lloyd always said
that in the Theater a lifetime was
a season, and a season a lifetime.
It's June now. That was - early
October... only last October. It
was a drizzly night, I remember I
asked the taxi to wait...

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. NEW YORK THEATER STREET - NIGHT

Traffic is not heavy, the shows have broken some half-hour
before. The rain is just a drizzle. 

There are other theaters on the street; display lights are
being extinguished. Going out just as Karen's taxi pulls up
is: MARGO CHANNING in 'AGED IN WOOD'. The marquis display
below includes "Max Fabian Presents" and "By Lloyd Richards."

The taxi comes to a stop at the alley. Karen can be seen
through the closed windows telling the driver to wait. Then
she gets out. She takes a step, hesitates, then looks about
curiously:

			KAREN'S VOICE
	 Where was she? Strange... I had
become so accustomed to seeing her
there night after night - I found
myself looking for a girl I'd never
spoken to, wondering where she
was...

She smiles a little at her own romanticism, puts her head
down and makes her way into the alley. 

EXT. ALLEY - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

Karen moves toward the stage door. She passes a recess in the
wall - perhaps an exit - about halfway. 

			EVE'S VOICE
		(softly)
Mrs. Richards...

Karen hesitates, looks. Eve is barely distinguishable in the
shadow of the recess. Karen smiles, waits. Eve comes out. A
gooseneck light above them reveals her... 

She wears a cheap trench coat, low-heeled shoes, a rain hat
stuck on the back of her head... Her large, luminous eyes
seem to glow up at Karen in the strange half-light. 

			KAREN
	 So there you are. It seemed odd,
suddenly, your not being there...

			EVE
	 Why should you think I wouldn't be?

			KAREN
	 Why should you be? After all, six
nights a week - for weeks - of
watching even Margo Channing enter
and leave a theater-

			EVE
	 I hope you don't mind my speaking
to you...

			KAREN
	 Not at all. 

			EVE
	 I've seen you so often - it took
every bit of courage I could raise-

			KAREN
		(smiles)
To speak to just a playwright's
wife? I'm the lowest form of
celebrity...

			EVE
	 You're Margo Channing's best
friend. You and your husband are
always with her - and Mr.
Sampson... what's he like?

			KAREN
		(grins)
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a
director.

			EVE
	 He's the best. 

			KAREN
	 He'll agree with you. Tell me, what
do you between the time Margo goes
in and comes out? Just huddle in
that doorway and wait? 

			EVE
	 Oh, no. I see the play. 

			KAREN
		(incredulous)
You see the play? You've seen the
play every performance?
(Eve nods)
But, don't you find it - I mean
apart from everything else - don't
you find it expensive? 

			EVE
	 Standing room doesn't cost much. I
manage. 

Karen contemplates Eve. Then she takes her arm. 

			KAREN
	 I'm going to take you to Margo...

			EVE
		(hanging back)
Oh, no...

			KAREN
	 She's got to meet you-

			EVE
	 No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be
just another tongue-tied gushing
fan...

Karen practically propels her toward the stage door. 

			KAREN
		(insisting)
There isn't another like you, there
couldn't be- 

			EVE
	 But if I'd known... maybe some
other time... I mean, looking like
this. 

			KAREN
	 You look just fine...
(they're at the stage
door)
... by the way. What's your name?

			EVE
	 Eve. Eve Harrington. 

Karen opens the door. They go in. 

INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

Everything, including the doorman, looks fireproof. 

Eve enters like a novitiate's first visit to the Vatican.
Karen, with a "Good evening, Gus -" to the doorman, leads the
way toward Margo's stage dressing room. Eve, drinking in the
wonderment of all the surveys, lags behind. Karen waits for
her to catch up... 

			EVE
	 You can breathe it - can't you?
Like some magic perfume...

Karen smiles, takes Eve's arm. They proceed to Margo's
dressing room. 

EXT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

No star on the closed door; the paint is peeling. A type
written chit, thumbtacked, says MISS CHANNING.

As Karen and Eve approach it, an uninhibited guffaw from
Margo makes them pause. 

			KAREN
		(whispers)
You wait a minute...
(smiles)
... now don't run away-

Eve smiles shakily. At the same moment:

			MARGO'S VOICE
		(loudly; through the door)
"Honey chile," I said, "if the
South had won the war, you could
write the same plays about the
North!"

Karen enters during the line. 

INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

It is a medium-sized box, lined with hot water pipes and
cracked plaster. It is furnished in beat-up wicker. A door
leads to an old-fashioned bathroom. 

Margo is at the dressing table. She wears an old wrapper, her
hair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies
before her like a dead poodle. Also before her is an almost
finished drink. 

LLOYD RICHARDS is stretched out on the wicker chaise. He's in
his late thirties, sensitive, literate. 

Between them, by the dressing table, is BIRDIE - Margo's
maid. Her age is unimportant. She was conceived during a
split week in Walla Walla and born in a carnival riot. She is
fiercely loyal to Margo. 

Karen enters during the line Margo started while she was
outside. Lloyd chuckles, Birdie cackles. 

			KAREN
	 Hi.
(she goes to kiss Lloyd)
Hello, darling-

			MARGO 
	 Hi. 
(she goes right on - in a
think "Suth'n" accent)
"Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't
think you can rightly say we lost
the wah, we was mo' stahved out,
you might say - an' that's what ah
don' unnerstand about all these
plays about love-stahved Suth'n
women - love is one thing we was
nevah stahved for the South!"

			LLOYD
	 How was the concert?

			KAREN
	 Loud.

			BIRDIE
	 Lemme fix you a drink. 

			KAREN
	 No thanks, Birdie. 

Karen laughs with them. 

			LLOYD
	 Margo's interview with a lady
reporter from the South-

			BIRDIE
	 The minute it gets printed they're
gonna fire on Gettysburg all over
again...

			MARGO
	 It was Fort Sumter they fired on-

			BIRDIE
	 I never played Fort Sumter.

She takes the wig into the bathroom. Margo starts creaming
the make-up off her face. 

			MARGO
	 Honey chili had a point. You know,
I can remember plays about women -
even from the South - where it
never even occurred to them whether
they wanted to marry their fathers
more than their brothers...

			LLOYD
	 That was way back...

			MARGO
	 Within your time, buster. Lloyd,
honey, be a playwright with guts.
Write me one about a nice, normal
woman who shoots her husband. 

Birdie comes out of the bathroom without the wig. 

			BIRDIE
	 You need new girdles. 

			MARGO
	 Buy some. 

			BIRDIE
	 The same size? 

			MARGO
	 Of course!

			BIRDIE
	 Well. I guess a real tight girdle
help when you're playin' a lunatic.  

She picks up Lloud empty glass, asks "more"? He shakes his
head. She pours herself a quick one. 

			KAREN
		(firmly)
Margo does not play a lunatic,
Birdie. 

			BIRDIE
	 I know. She just keeps hearin' her
dead father play the banjo. 

			MARGO
	 It's the tight girdle that does it. 

			KAREN
	 I find these wisecracks
increasingly less funny! 'Aged in
Wood' happens to be a fine and
distinguished play-

			LLOYD
	 - 'at's my loyal little woman. 

			KAREN
	 The critics thought so, the
audiences certainly think so -
packed houses, tickets for months
in advance - I can't see that
either of Lloyd's last two plays
have hurt you any!

			LLOYD
	 Easy, now...

			MARGO
		(grins)
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big
mouth...

			KAREN
		(mollified)
It's just that you get me so mad
sometimes... of all the women in
the world with nothing to complain
about-

			MARGO
		(dryly)
Ain't it the truth?

			KAREN
	 Yes, it is! You're talented,
famous, wealthy - people waiting
around night after night just to
see you, even in the wind and
rain...

			MARGO
	 Autograph fiends! They're not
people - those little beast who run
in packs like coyotes-

			KAREN
	 They're your fans, your audience-

			MARGO
	 They're nobody's fans! They're
juvenile delinquents, mental
detectives, they're nobody's
audience, they never see a play or
a movie, even - they're never
indoors long enough!

There is a pause. Lloyd applauds lightly. 

			KAREN
	 Well... there's one indoors now.
I've brought her back to see you. 

			MARGO
	 You've what? 

			KAREN
		(in a whisper)
She's just outside the door. 

			MARGO
		(to Birdie; also a
whisper)
The heave-ho. 

Birdie starts. Karen stops her. It's all in whisper, now,
until Eve comes in. 

			KAREN
	 You can't put her out, I
promised... Margo, you've got to
see her, she worships you, it's
like something out of a book-

			LLOYD
	 That book is out of print, Karen,
those days are gone.
Fans no longer pull the carriage
through the streets - they tear off
clothes and steal wrist watches...

			KAREN
	 If you'd only see her, you're her
whole life - you must have spotted
her by now, she's always there...

			MARGO
	 Kind of mousy trench coat and funny
hat?
(Karen nods)
How could I miss her? Every night
and matinee - well...

She looks to Birdie. 

			BIRDIE
	 Once George Jessel played my
hometown. For a girl, gettin' in to
see him was easy. Gettin' out was
the problem...

They all laugh. Karen goes to the door, opens it. Eve comes
in. Karen closes the door behind her. A moment. 

			EVE
		(simply)
I thought you'd forgotten about me. 

			KAREN
	 Not at all. 
(her arm through Eve's)
Margo, this is Eve Harrington. 

Margo changes swiftly into a first-lady-of-the-theater
manner. 

			MARGO
		(musically)
How do you do, my dear. 

			BIRDIE
		(mutters)
Oh, brother. 

			EVE
	 Hello, Miss Channing. 

			KAREN
	 My husband...

			LLOYD
		(nicely)
Hello, Miss Harrington. 

			EVE
	 How do you do, Mr. Richards. 

			MARGO
		(graciously)
And this is my good friend and
companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.

			BIRDIE
	 Oh, brother. 

			MARGO
	 Miss Coonan...

			LLOYD
		(to Birdie)
Oh brother what? 

			BIRDIE
	 When she gets like this... all of a
sudden she's playin' Hamlet's
mother...

			MARGO
		(quiet menace)
I'm sure you must have things to do
in the bathroom, Birdie dear. 

			BIRDIE
	 If I haven't, I'll find something
till you're normal.

She goes into the bathroom. 

			MARGO
	 Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down,
Miss Worthington? 

			KAREN
	 Harrington. 

			MARGO
	 I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't
you sit down? 

			EVE
	 Thank you. 

She sits. A short lull.

			MARGO
	 Would you like a drink? It's right
beside you... 

			KAREN
	 I was telling Margo and Lloyd about
how often you'd seen the play...

They start together, and stop in deference to each other.
They're a little flustered. But not Eve. 

			EVE
		(to Margo)
No, thank you.
(to Lloyd)
Yes. I've seen every performance. 

			LLOYD
		(delighted)
Every performance? Then - am I safe
in assuming you like it? 

			EVE
	 I'd like anything Miss Channing
played...

			MARGO
		(beams)
Would you, really? How sweet-

			LLOYD
		(flatly)
I doubt very much that you'd like
her in 'The Hairy Ape'.

			EVE
	 Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr.
Richards. I think that part of Miss
Channing's greatness lies in her
ability to choose the best plays...
your new play is for Miss Channing,
isn't it, Mr. Richards?

			MARGO
	 Of course it is.

			LLOYD
	 How'd hear about it?

			EVE
	 There was an item in the Times. i
like the title. 'Footsteps on the
Ceiling'.

			LLOYD
	 Let's get back to this one. Have
you really seen every performance? 
(Eve nods)
Why? I'm curious...

Eve looks at Margo, then drops her eyes. 

			EVE
	 Well. If I didn't come to see the
play, I wouldn't have anywhere else
to go. 

			MARGO
	 There are other plays...

			EVE
	 Not with you in them. Not by Mr.
Richards...

			LLOYD
	 But you must have friends, a
family, a home-

Eve pauses. Then shakes her head. 

			KAREN
	 Tell us about it - Eve...

Eve looks at her - grateful because Karen called her "Eve."
Then away, again...

			EVE
	 If I only knew how...

			KAREN
	 Try...

			EVE
	 Well...

Birdie comes out of the bathroom. Everybody looks at her
sharply. She realizes she's in on something important. She
closes the door quietly, leans against it.

			EVE
	 Well... it started with the play
before this one...

			LLOYD
	 'Remembrance'.

			MARGO
	 Did you see it here in New York?

			EVE
	 San Francisco. It was the last
week. I went one night... the most
important night in my life - until
this one. Anyway... I found myself
going the next night - and the next
and the next. Every performance.
Then, when the show went East - I
went East. 

			BIRDIE
	 I'll never forget that blizzard the
night we played Cheyenne. A cold
night. First time I ever saw a
brassiere break like a piece of
matzos... 

Eve looks at her unsmilingly, then back to her hands. 

			KAREN
	 Eve... why don't you start at the
beginning? 

			EVE
	 It couldn't possibly interest you. 

			MARGO
	 Please...

Eve speaks simply and without self-pity. 

			EVE
	 I guess it started back home.
Wisconsin, that is. There was just
mum, and dad - and me. I was the
only child, and I made believe a
lot when I was a kid - I acted out
all sorts of things... what they
were isn't important. But somehow
acting and make-believe began to
fill up my life more and more, it
got so that I couldn't tell the
real from the unreal except that
the unreal seemed more real to
me... I'm talking a lot of
gibberish, aren't I? 

			LLOYD
	 Not at all...

			EVE
	 Farmers were poor in those days,
that's what dad was - a farmer. I
had to help out. So I quit school
and I went to Milwaukee. I became a
secretary. In a brewery.
(she smiles)
When you're a secretary in a
brewery - it's pretty hard to make
believe you're anything else.
Everything is beer. It wasn't much
fun, but it helped at home -  and
there was a Little Theater Group...
like a drop of rain in the desert.
That's where I met Eddie. He was a
radio technician. We played
'Liliom' for three performances, I
was awful - then the war came, and
we got married. Eddie was in the
air force - and they sent him to
the South Pacific. You were with
the O.W.I., weren't you Mr.
Richards?
(Lloyd nods)
That's what 'Who's Who' says...
well, with Eddie gone, my life went
back to beer. Except for a letter a
week. One week Eddie wrote he had a
leave coming up. I'd saved my money
and vacation time. I went to San
Francisco to meet him. 
(a slight pause)
Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded
the telegram from Milwaukee - the
one that came from Washington to
say that Eddie wasn't coming at
all. That Eddie was dead...
(Karen puts her hand on
Lloyd's)
... so I figured I'd stay in San
Francisco. i was alone, but
couldn't go back without Eddie. I
found a job. And his insurance
helped... and there were theaters
in San Francisco. And one night
Margo Channing came to play in
'Remembrance'... and I went to see
it. And - well - here I am...

She finishes dry-eyes and self-composed. Margo squeezes the
bridge of her nose, dabs at her eyes. 

			BIRDIE
		(finally)
What a story. Everything but the
bloodhounds snappin' at her rear
end...

That breaks the spell. Margo turns to her-

			MARGO
	 There are some human experiences,
Birdie, that do not take place in a
vaudeville house - and that even a
fifth-rate vaudevillian should
understand and respect!
(to Eve)
I want to apologize for Birdie's-

			BIRDIE
		(snaps in)
You don't have to apologize for me!
(to Eve)
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
It's just my way of talkin'...

			EVE
		(nicely)
You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss
Coonan...

			BIRDIE
	 Call me Birdie. 
(to Margo)
As for bein' fifth-rate - i closed
the first half for eleven years an'
you know it!

She slams into the bathroom again. At that precise instant
BILL SAMPSON flings open the door to the dressing room. He's
youngish, vital, undisciplined. He lugs a beat-up suitcase
which he drops as he crosses to Margo-

			BILL
	 Forty-five minutes from now my
plane takes off and how do I find
you? Not ready yet, looking like a
junk yard-

			MARGO
	 Thank you so much. 

			BILL
	 Is it sabotage, does my career mean
nothing to you? Have you no human
consideration? 

			MARGO
	 Show me a human and I might have!

			KAREN
		(conscious of Eve)
Bill...

			BILL
	 The air lines have clocks, even if
you haven't! I start shooting a
week from Monday - Zanuck is
impatient, he wants me, he needs
me!

			KAREN
		(louder)
Bill-

			MARGO
	 Zanuck, Zanuck, Zanuck! What are
you two - lovers? 

Bill grins suddenly, drops to one knee beside her.

			BILL
		(smiling)
Only in some ways. You're
prettier...

			MARGO
	 I'm a junk yard. 

			KAREN
		(yells)
Bill!

			BILL
		(vaguely; to Karen)
Huh?

			KAREN
	 This is Eve Harrington.

Bill flashes a fleeting look at Eve. 

			BILL
	 Hi.
(to Margo)
My wonderful junk yard. The mystery
and dreams you find in a junk yard-

			MARGO
		(kisses him)
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic. 

Bill grins, rises, sees Eve as if for the first time. 

			BILL
	 Hello, what's your name? 

			EVE
	 Eve. Eve Harrington. 

			KAREN
	 You've already met. 

			BILL
	 Where? 

			KAREN
	 Right here. A minute ago. 

			BILL
	 That's nice. 

			MARGO
	 She, too, is a great admirer of
yours. 

			BIRDIE
	 Imagine. All this admiration in
just one room. 

			BILL
	 Take your mistress into the
bathroom and dress her.
(Birdie opens her mouth)
Without comment. 

Birdie shuts it and goes into the bathroom. In a moment we
hear a shower start to run. Eve gets up. 

			KAREN
	 You're not going, are you?

			EVE
	 I think I'd better. It's been -
well, I can hardly find the words
to say how it's been...

			MARGO
		(rises)
No, don't go...

			EVE
	 The four of you must have so much
to say to each other - with Mr.
Sampson leaving...

Margo, impulsively crosses to Eve. 

			MARGO
	 Stick around. Please. Tell you what
- we'll put Stanislavsky on his
plane, you and I, then go somewhere
and talk. 

			EVE
	 Well - if I'm not in the way...

			MARGO
	 I won't be a minute. 

She darts into the bathroom. Eve sits down again. 

			KAREN
	 Lloyd, we've got to go-

Lloyd gets up. Karen crosses to pound on the bathroom door.
She yells - the shower is going...

			KAREN
	 Margo, good night! I'll call you
tomorrow!

Margo's answer is lost in the shower noise. Karen crosses to
kiss Bill. She's joined by Lloyd. 

			KAREN
	 Good luck, genius...

			BILL
	 Geniuses don't need good luck.
(he grins)
I do. 

			LLOYD
	 I'm not worried about you. 

			BILL
	 Keep the thought. 

They shake hands warmly. Karen and Lloyd move to Eve. 

			KAREN
	 Good night, Eve. I hope I see you
again soon-

			EVE
	 I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow
matinee-

			KAREN
	 Not just that way. As a friend...

			EVE
	 I'd like that. 

			LLOYD
	 It's been a real pleasure, Eve. 

			EVE
	 I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good
night...

Lloyd shakes her hand, crosses to join Karen who waits at the
open dressing room door. 

			EVE
	 Mrs. Richards.
(Karen and Lloyd look
back)
... I'll never forget this night as
long as I live. And I'll never
forget you for making it possible. 

Karen smiles warmly. She closes the door. They leave. 

			KAREN'S VOICE
	 - and I'll never forget you, Eve.
Where were we going that night,
Lloyd and I? Funny the things you
remember - and the things you
don't...

INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Eve sits on the same chair. Bill keeps moving around. Eve
never takes her eyes off him. He offers her a cigarette. She
shakes her head. He looks at his watch. 

			EVE
	 You said forty-seven minutes.
You'll never make it. 

			BILL
		(grins)
I told you a lie. We'll make it
easily. Margo's got no more
conception of time than a halibut. 

He goes to the dressing table, picks up Margo's pocketbook,
opens it. He finds a letter. He glances at it, puts it back.

			BILL
	 She's been carrying that letter
around for weeks. I've read it
three times...

There's a sudden sharp yelp from the bathroom. 

			MARGO'S VOICE
	 You're supposed to zip the zipper -
not me. 

			BIRDIE'S VOICE
	 Like tryin' to zip a pretzel -
stand still!

Bill grins. 

			BILL
	 What a documentary those two would
make... like the mongoose and the
cobra-

He sprawls on the chaise, closes his eyes. A pause.

			EVE
		(finally)
So you're going to Hollywood.

Bill grunts in the affirmative. Silence. 

			BILL
	 Why?

			EVE
	 I just wondered.

			BILL
	 Just wondered what?

			EVE
	 Why.

			BILL
	 Why what?

			EVE
	 Why you have to go out there.

			BILL
	 I don't have to. I want to.

			EVE
	 Is it the money?

			BILL
	 Eighty percent of it will go for
taxes. 

			EVE
	 Then why? Why, if you're the best
and most successful young director
in the Theater-

			BILL
	 The Theatuh, the Theatuh-
(he sits up)
- what book of rules says the
Theater exists only within some
ugly buildings crowded into one
square mile of New York City? Or
London, Paris or Vienna?
(he gets up)
Listen, junior. And learn. Want to
know what the Theater is? A flea
circus. Also opera. Also rodeos,
carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal
dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man
band - all Theater. Wherever
there's magic and make-believe and
an audience - there's Theater.
Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone
Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles
Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty
Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora
Duse. You don't understand them
all, you don't like them all, why
should you? The Theater's for
everybody - you included, but not
exclusively - so don't approve or
disapprove. It may not be your
Theater, but it's Theater of
somebody, somewhere. 

			EVE
	 I just asked a simple question. 

			BILL
		(grins)
And I shot my mouth off. Nothing
personal, junior, no offense...
(he sits back down)
... it's just that there's so much
bushwah in this Ivory Green Room
they call the Theatuh - sometimes
it gets up around my chin...

He lies down again. 

			EVE
	 But Hollywood. You mustn't stay
there. 

			BILL
		(he closes his eyes)
It's only one picture deal. 

			EVE
	 So few come back...

			BILL
	 Yeah. They keep you under drugs out
there with armed guards...

A pause.

			EVE
	 I read George Jean Nathan every
week.

			BILL
	 Also Addison deWitt. 

			EVE
	 Every day. 

			BILL
	 You didn't have to tell me. 

Margo, putting on an earring, buzzes out of the bathroom
followed by Birdie. Bill sits up. 

			MARGO
		(en route)
I understand it's the latest thing -
just one earring. If it isn't, it's
going to be - I can't find the
other...

She grabs her pocketbook, starts rummaging. Out comes the
letter...

			BILL
	 Throw that dreary thing away, it
bores me-

Margo drops it in the wastebasket, keeps rummaging. 

			EVE
		(concerned)
Where do you suppose it could be?

			BIRDIE
	 It'll show up.

			MARGO
		(gives up)
Oh well...
(to Birdie)
... look through the wigs, maybe it
got caught-

			BILL
	 Real diamonds in a wig. The world
we live in...

			MARGO
		(she's been looking)
Where's my coat?

			BIRDIE
	 Right where you left it...

She goes behind the chaise. She comes up with a magnificent
mink. 

			BILL
		(to Margo)
The seams. 

Margo starts to straighten them. 

			MARGO
		(to Eve)
Can't keep his eyes off my legs. 

			BILL
	 Like a nylon lemon peel-

			MARGO
		(straightens up)
Byron couldn't have said it more
graciously... here we go-

By now she's in the coat and has Eve's arm, heading for the
door. Bill puts his arms around Birdie. 

			BILL
	 Got any messages? What do you want
me to tell Tyrone Power?

			BIRDIE
	 Just give him my phone number, I'll
tell him myself. 

Bill kisses her cheek. She kisses Bill. 

			BIRDIE
	 Kill the people. 
(to Margo)
Got your key?

			MARGO
		(nods)
See you home...

Margo and Eve precede Bill out of the door...

EXT. LAGUARDIA FIELD - NIGHT

American Airlines baggage counter. The rain has stopped, but
it's wet. 

Margo, Eve, and Bill are stymied behind two or three couples
waiting to be checked in. Margo's arm is through Bill's. They
become increasingly aware of their imminent separation. Eve
senses her superfluity. 

A lull. Bill cranes at the passenger heading the line, in
earnest conversation with the dispatcher. He sighs. 

			MARGO
	 They have to time it so everybody
gets on at the last minute. So they
can close the doors and let you
sit. 

The man up ahead moves on.

			BILL
	 Ah...

			EVE
	 I have a suggestion.
(they look at her)
There's really not much time left -
I mean, you haven't had a minute
alone yet, and - well, I could take
care of everything here and meet
you at the gate with the ticket...
if you'd like. 

			BILL
	 I think we'd like very much. Sure
you won't mind?

			EVE
	 Of course not. 

Bill hands Eve the ticket. Margo smiles gratefully at her.
Eve smiles back. 

EXT. PASSAGE AND GATE - LAGUARDIA - NIGHT

It's covered, with glass windows. Margo's arm is in Bill's. 

			BILL
	 She's quite a girl, that what's-her
name...

			MARGO
	 Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that
way...

			BILL
	 The lack of pretense, that sort of
strange directness and
understanding-

			MARGO
	 Did she tell you about the Theater
and what it meant? 

			BILL
		(grins)
I told her. I sounded off. 

			MARGO
	 All the religions in the world
rolled into one, and we're Gods and
Goddesses... isn't it silly,
suddenly I've developed a big
protective feeling for her - a lamb
loose in our big stone jungle...

Bill pauses and pulls her to one side. Some passengers go by.
A pause. 

			MARGO
	 Take care of yourself out there...

			BILL
	 I understand they've got the
Indians pretty well in hand...

			MARGO
	 Bill...

			BILL
	 Huh?

			MARGO
	 Don't get stuck on some glamour
puss-

			BILL
	 I'll try.

			MARGO
	 You're not such a bargain, you
know, conceited and thoughtless and
messy-

			BILL
	 Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.

			MARGO
	 - you're a setup for some gorgeous
wide-eyed young babe.

			BILL
	 How childish are you going to get
before you quit it? 

			MARGO
	 I don't want to be childish, I'd
settle for just a few years-

			BILL
		(firmly)
And cut that out right now. 

			MARGO
	 Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?

			BILL
	 As of this moment you're six years
old...

He starts to kiss her, stops when he becomes aware of Eve
standing near them. She has his ticket in her hand. 

			EVE
	 All ready.

She hands Bill his ticket, they start toward the gate. 

INT. BOARDING GATE - LAGUARDIA - NIGHT

The D.C. 6 in the b.g. A few visitors. Bill hands his ticket
to the guard, turns to Eve. 

			BILL
	 Thanks for your help... good luck. 

			EVE
	 Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.

Bill puts his arms around Margo. 

			BILL
	 Knit me a muffler. 

			MARGO
	 Call me when you get in...

They kiss. Margo's arms tighten desperately. Bill pulls away,
kisses her again lightly, starts for the plane. Margo turns
away. Eve puts her arms through Margo's. 

Bill pauses en route to the plane. 

			BILL
	 Hey - junior...

Margo turns to look at him with Eve. 

			BILL
	 Keep your eyes on her. Don't let
her get lonely. She's a loose lamb
in a jungle...

Eve looks at Margo. Margo smiles. 

			EVE
	 Don't worry...

Bill waves, climbs aboard. The door is closed behind him, the
departure routine starts...

Margo and eve turn to go. They walk down the passage. As they
walk, Eve gently disengages her arm from Margo's and puts it
comfortingly about her...

			MARGO'S VOICE
	 That same night we sent for Eve's
things, her few pitiful
possessions... she moved into the
little guest room on the top
floor...

INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

MARGO slides her fingers reflectively up and down the sides
of the almost empty highball glass. 

			MARGO'S VOICE
	 ... she cried when she saw it - it
was so like her little room back
home in Wisconsin.

ADDISON eyeing her quizzically. He offers her the whiskey. 

MARGO shakes her head, absently. She looks down at her glass
again. Then, she raises her eyes to look at Eve. 

			MARGO'S VOICE
	 ... the next three weeks were out
of a fairy tale - and I was
Cinderella in the last act. Eve
became my sister, lawyer, mother,
friend, psychiatrist and cop - the
honeymoon was on...

INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

It's one floor above street level. A long narrow room,
smartly furnished - including a Sarah Siddons Award. 

MARGO'S NARRATIVE overlaps into the scene which is a SILENT
ONE. 

Eve sits at a smart desk. She is just arranging a stack of
letters which she carries to Margo with a pen. Margo sits
comfortably by the fire with a play script. She hands the
scrips up to Eve, shakes her head and holds her nose. Eve
smiles, takes the script, hands Margo the letters to sign.

Birdie comes in with a tea tray which she sets on a low table
before the fire. 

The phone rings.

Birdie and Eve both go for it. Eve gets there first. By her
polite but negative attitude, we know she is giving someone a
skillful brush-off.

Birdie glares first at her, then at Margo. 

Margo leans her head back, closes her eyes blissfully...

Birdie slams the double door to the landing on her way out...

INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - DAY

From the wings. The audience is never visible. Eve in the
f.g. Margo and company taking a curtain call. Tumultuous
applause... the curtain falls. The cast, except for Margo and
two male leads, walk off. The curtain rises again...

EVE, watching and listening to the storm of applause. Her
eyes shine, she clasps and unclasps her hands...

THE STAGE, Eve again in the f.g., but closer. Again the
curtain falls. This time the two men go off. Curtain rises on
Margo alone. If anything, the applause builds...

EVE, that same hypnotic look... there are tears in her eyes.
The curtain falls offscene, then rises again - 

MARGO, the curtain falls again between her and CAMERA...

BACKSTAGE, the curtain just settling on the floor. Margo
starts off. 

			STAGE MANAGER
	 One more?

			MARGO
		(shakes her head)
From now on it's not applause -
just something to do till the
aisles get less crowded...

She walks as she talks and winds up at Eve - still in the
wings. Eve's eyes are wet, she dabs at her nose. 

			MARGO
	 What - again?

			EVE
	 I could watch you play that last
scene a thousand times and cry
every time-

			MARGO
		(grins)
Performance number one thousand of
this one - if I play it that long -
will take place in a well-padded
booby hatch...

She takes Eve's arm, they stroll toward her dressing room. 

			EVE
	 I must say you can certainly tell
Mr. Sampson's been gone a month. 

			MARGO
	 You certainly can. Especially if
you're me between now and tomorrow
morning...

			EVE
	 I mean the performance. Except for
you, you'd think he'd never even
directed it - it's disgraceful the
way they change everything
around...

			MARGO
		(smiles)
Well, teacher's away and actors
will be actors...

			EVE
	 During your second act scene with
your father, Roger Ferraday's
supposed to stay way upstage at the
arch. He's been coming closer down
every night...

			MARGO
	 When he gets too close, I'll spit
in his eye.

They're at her dressing room by now. Margo's been unhooking
her gown, with Eve's help. They go in. 

INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

It's undergone quite a change. A new carpet, chintz covers
for the furniture, new lampshades, dainty curtains across the
filthy barred window. 

Birdie waits within. She's listening to a fight; she shuts it
off as they enter.

			MARGO
		(entering)
You bought the new girdles a size
smaller. I can feel it. 

			BIRDIE
	 Something maybe grew a size bigger.

			MARGO
	 When we get home you're going to
get into one of those girdles and
act for two and half hours. 

			BIRDIE
	 I couldn't get into the girdle in
two an' a half hours...

Margo's out of her wig and dress by now. She gets into her
robe, sits at the dressing table. Eve's on the chaise, by the
discarded costume.

			EVE
	 You haven't noticed my latest bit
of interior decorating...

			MARGO
		(turns, looks)
Well, you've done so much... what's
new? 

			EVE
	 The curtains. I made them myself. 

			MARGO
	 They are lovely. Aren't they
lovely, Birdie? 

			BIRDIE
	 Adorable. We now got everything a
dressing room needs except a
basketball hoop. 

			MARGO
	 Just because you can't even work a
zipper. It was very thoughtful,
Eve, and I appreciate it- 

A pause. Eve rises, picking up Margo's costume.

			EVE
	 While you're cleaning up, I'll take
this to the wardrobe mistress-

			MARGO
	 Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be
along for it in a minute. 

			EVE
	 No trouble at all. 

And she goes out with the costume. Birdie opens her mouth,
shuts it, then opens it again. 

			BIRDIE
	 If I may so bold as to say
something - did you ever hear the
word "union"?

			MARGO
	 Behind in your dues? How much?

			BIRDIE
	 I haven't got a union. I'm slave
labor. 

			MARGO
	 Well?

			BIRDIE
	 But the wardrobe women have got
one. And next to a tenor, a
wardrobe woman is the touchiest
thing in show business-

			MARGO
		(catching on)
Oh-oh.

			BIRDIE
	 She's got two things to do - carry
clothes an' press 'em wrong - an'
just let anybody else muscle in...

As she talks, Margo hurries to the door and out after Eve. 

INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

Margo pops out, looks for Eve, then stares in amazement. 

EVE, near the wings. She stands before a couple of cheval
mirrors set up for cast members. She has Margo's dress held
up against her body. She turns this way and that, bows as if
to applause - mimicking Margo exactly...

MARGO watches her curiously. Then she smiles. 

			MARGO
		(calling)
Eve-

EVE, startled, whips the gown away, turns to Margo. 

MARGO smiles understandingly. 

			MARGO
		(quietly)
I think we'd better let Mrs. Brown
pick up the wardrobe...

Wordlessly, Eve brings it toward her...

INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Margo's asleep. A bedside clock with a luminous dial reads 3
A.M. exactly. The phone rings. Her head comes up out of the
pillow, she shakes it. She fumbles, switches on a lamp, then
picks up the phone. 

			MARGO
	 Hello..

			OPERATOR'S VOICE
	 We are ready with your call to
Beverly Hills...

			MARGO
	 Call, what call?

			OPERATOR'S VOICE
	 It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo
Channing? 

			MARGO
	 That's right, but I don't
understand-

			OPERATOR'S VOICE
	 We are ready with the call you
placed for 12 midnight, California
time, to Mr. William Sampson in
Beverly Hills...

			MARGO
	 I placed...?

			OPERATOR'S VOICE
	 Go ahead, please...

			BILL'S VOICE
		(a loud, happy squawk)
Margo! What a wonderful surprise!

Margo jumps at his vehemence. As she does so, the SCREEN
WIPES DOWN DIAGONALLY LEFT TO RIGHT, so that Margo remains in
the lower right-hand diagonal of the screen and Bill is
disclosed in the upper left. He, too, is in bed, reading. His
clock says midnight. 

			BILL
		(continuing)
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin'
thing to do-

			MARGO
		(dazed)
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?

			BILL
	 You're my girl, aren't you?

			MARGO
	 That I am...

			BILL
	 Then you're crazy. 

			MARGO
		(nods in agreement)
When - when are you coming back? 

			BILL 
	 I leave in a week - the picture's
all wrapped up, we previewed last
night... those previews. Like
opening out of town, but
terrifying. There's nothing you can
do, you're trapped, you're in a tin
can-

			MARGO
	 - in a tin can, cellophane or
wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want
you home...

			BILL 
	 You in a hurry?

			MARGO
	 A big hurry, be quick about it - so
good night, darling, and sleep
tight...

			BILL 
	 Wait a minute! You can't hang up,
you haven't even said it-

			MARGO
	 Bill, you know how much I do - but
over the phone, now really, that's
kid stuff...

			BILL
	 Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen
every day, I want to heat it - and
if you won't say it, you can sing
it...

			MARGO
		(convinced she's gone mad)
Sing it?

			BILL 
	 Sure! Like the Western Union boys
used to do...

Margo's eyes pop. Her jaw and the phone sag. 

			MARGO
	 Bill... Bill, it's your birthday. 

			BILL 
	 And who remembered it? Who was
there on the dot, at twelve
midnight...?

Margo knows damn well it wasn't she. 

			MARGO
		(miserably)
Happy birthday, darling...

			BILL 
	 The reading could have been better,
but you said it - now "many happy
returns of the day..."

			MARGO
		(the same)
Many happy returns of the day...

			BILL 
	 I get a party, don't I?

			MARGO
	 Of course, birthday and welcome
home... who'll I ask?

			BILL 
		(laughs)
It's no secret, I know all about
the party - Eve wrote me...

			MARGO
	 She did...?

			 BILL 
	 She hasn't missed a week since I
left - but you know all that, you
probably tell her what to write...
anyway, I sent her a list of people
to ask - check with her. 

			MARGO
	 Yeah... I will.

			BILL 
	 How is Eve? Okay?

			MARGO
	 Okay. 

			BILL 
	 I love you...

			MARGO
		(mutters)
I'll check with Eve...

			BILL
	 What? 

			MARGO
	 I love you too. Good night, darling-

			BILL 
	 See you...

Margo hangs up. Bill hangs up. He replaces the phone, picks
up his book... SLOW WIPE until ONLY MARGO is on screen. She
puts her phone away. She gets a cigarette. She lights it. She
rolls over on her back...

INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - DAY

Margo is propped up in bed, still reflective. Birdie comes in
with her breakfast tray and a "hi" which gets a "hi" from
Margo. She starts on some petty chores. Margo takes a sip of
orange juice...

			MARGO
	 Birdie-

			BIRDIE
	 Hmm?

			MARGO
	 You don't like Eve, do you?

			BIRDIE
	 Do you want an argument or an
answer?

			MARGO
	 An answer. 

			BIRDIE
	 No. 

			MARGO
	 Why not?

			BIRDIE
	 Now you want an argument. 

			MARGO
	 She works hard. 

			BIRDIE
	 Night an' day. 

			MARGO
	 She's loyal and efficient-

			BIRDIE
	 Like an agent with one client.

			MARGO
	 She thinks only for me...
(no answer from Birdie)
... doesn't she? 

			BIRDIE
		(finally)
Well... let's say she thinks only
about you, anyway...

			MARGO
	 How do you mean that?

Birdie stops whatever it is she's doing.

			BIRDIE
	 I'll tell you how. Like - let's see
- like she was studyin' you, like
you were a play or a book or a set
of blueprints. How you walk, talk,
think, eat, sleep-

			MARGO
		(breaks in; sharply)
I'm sure that's very flattering,
Birdie, and I'm sure there's
nothing wrong with that!

There is a sharp, brisk knock. Eve comes in. She's dressed in
a smart suit. She carries a leather portfolio.

			EVE
	 Good morning!

Margo says "good morning," Birdie says nothing. Eve shows off
the suit, proudly. 

			EVE
	 Well - what do you think of my
elegant new suit? 

			MARGO
	 Very becoming. It looks better on
you than it did on me. 

			EVE
		(scoffs)
I can imagine... you know, all it
needed was some taking in here and
letting out there - are you sure
you won't want it yourself? 

			MARGO
	 Quite sure. I find it just a bit
too - too "Seventeenish" for me...

			EVE 
		(laughs)
Oh, come now, as though you were an
old lady... I'm on my way. Is there
anything more you've thought of-?

			MARGO
	 There's the script to go back to
the Guild-

			EVE
	 I've got it. 

			MARGO
	 - and those checks or whatever it
is for the income tax man. 

			EVE
	 Right here. 

			MARGO
	 It seems I can't think of a thing
you haven't thought of...

			EVE
		(smile)
That's my job.
(she turns to go)
See you at tea time...

			MARGO
	 Eve...
(Eve turns at the door)
... by any chance, did you place a
call from me to Bill for midnight
California time? 

			EVE
		(gasps)
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-

			MARGO
	 Yes, dear. You forgot all about it. 

			EVE
	 Well, I was sure you'd want to, of
course, being his birthday, and
you've been so busy these past few
days, and last night I meant to
tell you before you went out with
the Richards - and I guess I was
asleep when you got home...

			MARGO
	 Yes, I guess you were. It - it was
very thoughtful of you, Eve. 

			EVE
	 Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly
wouldn't forget that. You'd never
forgive me. 
(she smiles shyly)
As a matter of fact, I sent him a
telegram myself...

And she's gone. Margo stares at the closed door. Then at
Birdie. Birdie, without comment, goes out. Margo, alone,
looks down at her orange juice. Absently, she twirls it in
its bed of shaved ice...

INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT

MARGO, reflectively twirling her highball glass. The applause
continues. She lifts her glass to drink. Her glance meets
Karen's. She raises the glass in a silent toast.   

KAREN smiles wanly at Margo's toast. Then the smile fades as
she looks reflectively back to Eve...

			KAREN'S VOICE
	 I saw Eve quite often after our
first meeting, but we never really
talked again - until the party
Margo gave for Bill when he
returned from Hollywood...

INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's January. The bed is littered with fur coats. Through the
open door, from the floor below, the murmur of a party at a
late hour. No hilarity. 

			KAREN'S VOICE
	 It's always convenient at a party
to know the hostess well enough to
use her bedroom rather than go
where all the others have to go...

Karen is making repairs at Margo's dressing table. Eve
enters, carrying a magnificent sable coat which she drops on
the bed. 

			KAREN
	 Now who's show up at this hour?
It's time people went home - hold
that coat up...
(Eve holds it up; Karen
whistles)
... whose is it? 

			EVE
	 Some Hollywood movie star, her
plane got in late. 

			KAREN
	 Discouraging, isn't it? Women with
furs like that where it never gets
cold...

			EVE
	 Hollywood. 

			KAREN
	 Tell me, Eve - how are things with
you? Happy? 

Eve melts into warmth. She beams, sits on the bed. Karen has
spun around on the dressing table stool. 

			EVE
	 There should be a new word for
happiness. Being here with Miss
Channing has been - I just can't
say, she's been so wonderful, done
so much for me-

			KAREN
		(smiles)
Lloyd says Margo compensates for
underplaying on the stage by
overplaying reality...
(she gets up, gets her
coat)
... next to that sable, my new mink
seems like an old bedjacket... 
(throws it over her
shoulder)
... you've done your share, Eve.
You've worked wonders with Margo...

She starts out. 

			EVE
		(hesitantly)
Mrs. Richards. 

			KAREN
		(pauses, smiles)
Karen.

			EVE
	 Karen...
(she picks at the
coverlet)
... isn't it awful, I'm about to
ask you for another favor - after
all you've already done. 

			KAREN
		(crosses to her)
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've
got to stop thinking of yourself as
one of the Hundred Neediest
Cases... what is it? 

			EVE
	 Well... Miss Channing's affairs are
in such good shape... there isn't
enough to keep me as busy as I
should be, really - not that I've
ever considered anything that would
take me away from her... but the
other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian
tell Miss Channing that her
understudy was going to have a
baby, and they'd have to replace
her... 

She looks down at the coverlet once more. 

			KAREN
	 ... you want to be Margo's new
understudy. 

			EVE
	 I don't let myself think about it,
even- 
(she looks up, rises as
she speaks)
- but I do know the part so well,
and every bit of the staging,
there'd be no need to break in a
new girl-
(suddenly afraid, she
sits)
- but suppose I had to go on one
night? To an audience that came to
see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't
possibly...

			KAREN
		(laughs)
Don't worry too much about that.
Margo just doesn't miss
performances. If she can walk,
crawl or roll - she plays. 

			EVE
		(nods proudly)
The show must go on. 

			KAREN
	 No, dear. Margo must go on. 
(she sits beside Eve)
As a matter of fact, I see no
reason why you shouldn't be Margo's
understudy...

			EVE
	 Do you think Miss Channing would
approve?

			KAREN
	 I think she would cheer. 

			EVE
	 But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-

			KAREN
	 They'll do as they're told.

Eve smiles a little. A pause. 

			EVE
	 Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian
about it? 

			KAREN
	 Of course. 

			EVE
	 You won't forget it?

			KAREN
	 I won't forget. 

			EVE
	 I seem to be forever thanking you
for something, don't I?

She hugs Karen, leaves. She nearly collides with Birdie on
her way in. 

			BIRDIE
	 The bed looks like a dead animal
act. Which one is sables?

			KAREN
		(pointing)
But she just got here...

			BIRDIE
	 She's on her way. With half the men
in the joint. 
(she hold up the coat)
It's only a fur coat...

			KAREN
	 What did you expect - live sables?

			BIRDIE
	 A diamond collar, gold sleeves -
you know, picture people...

They start out. 

			KAREN
	 Bill says actors out there eat just
as infrequently as here-

			BIRDIE
	 They can always grab oranges off
trees. This you can't do in Times
Square...

Through the open door, we see them go down the stairs and out
of sight. 

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING AND STAIRS - NIGHT

Karen and Birdie come down the stairs to Bill, Max, Addison,
a blonde young lady named MISS CASWELL (Addison's protegee-of
the-moment) - and, at the feet of Bill and Addison... Eve.
They are all seated on the steps.

Birdie goes through and down the stairs to the first floor.
Karen remains with the others. 

Addison is holding forth:

			ADDISON 
	 Every now and then, some elder
statesman of the Theater or cinema
assures the public that actors and
actresses are just plain folk.
Ignoring the fact that their
greatest attraction to the public
is their complete lack of
resemblance to normal human beings.

			MISS CASWELL
		(as Birdie and the sables
pass)
Now there's something a girl could
make sacrifices for. 

			BILL'S VOICE
	 And probably has. 

			MISS CASWELL
	 Sable. 

			MAX
		(to Miss Caswell)
Did you say sable - or Gable?

			MISS CASWELL
	 Either one. 

			ADDISON
	 It is senseless to insist that
theatrical folk in New York,
Hollywood and London are no
different from the good people of
Des Moines, Chillicothe and
Liverpool. By and large, we are
concentrated gatherings of
neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional
misfits, and precocious children-

			MAX
		(to Bill)
Gable. Why a feller like that don't
come East to do a play...

			BILL 
		(nods)
He must be miserable, the life he
lives out there-

			ADDISON
	 These so-called abnormalities -
they're our stock in trade, they
make us actors, writers, directors,
et cetera in the first place-

			MAX
	 Answer me this. What makes a man
become a producer?

			ADDISON 
	 What makes a man walk into a lion
cage with nothing but a chair?

			MAX
	 This answer satisfies me a hundred
percent. 

			ADDISON 
	 We all have abnormality in common.
We are a breed apart from the rest
of the humanity, we Theater folk.
We are the original displaced
personalities...

			BILL 
		(laughs; to Eve)
You don't have to read his column
tomorrow - you just heard it. I
don't agree, Addison...

			ADDISON
	 That happens to be your particular
abnormality. 

			BILL 
	 Oh, I admit there's a screwball
element in the Theater. It sticks
out, it's got spotlights on it and
a brass band. But it isn't basic,
it isn't standard - if it were, the
Theater couldn't survive...

			MISS CASWELL
		(to a passing butler)
Oh, waiter...

The butler goes right by.

			ADDISON
	 That isn't a waiter, my dear.
That's a butler. 

			MISS CASWELL
	 Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler,"
can I? Maybe somebody's name is
Butler...

			ADDISON 
	 You have a point. An idiotic one,
but a point. 

			MISS CASWELL
	 I don't want to make trouble. All I
want is a drink. 

			MAX
		(getting up)
Leave me get you one...

			MISS CASWELL
		(pitching)
Oh, thank you, Mr. Fabian.

Max leaves with her empty glass. 

			ADDISON
	 Well done. I see your career rising
in the East like the sun...
(to Bill)
... you were saying?

			BILL 
	 I was saying that the Theater is
nine-tenths hard work. Work done
the hard way - by sweat,
application and craftsmanship. I'll
agree to this - that to be a good
actor, actress, or anything else in
the Theater, means wanting to be
that more than anything else in the
world...

			EVE
		(abruptly)
Yes. Yes, it does. 

			BILL
		(goes on)
It means concentration of ambition,
desire, and sacrifice such as no
other profession demands... And
I'll agree that the man or woman
who accepts those terms can't be
ordinary, can't be - just someone.
To give so much for almost always
so little...

Eve speaks almost unaware of what she says. She looks at no
one in particular, just off...

			EVE
	 So little. So little, did you say?
Why, if there's nothing else -
there's applause. It's like - like
waves of love coming over the
footlights and wrapping you up.
Imagine...
To know, every night, that
different hundreds of people love
you... they smile, their eyes shine
- you've pleased them, they want
you, you belong. Just that alone is
worth anything...

She becomes aware of Addison's strange smile, of Bill's looks
of warm interest. She's embarrassed, she turns away - then
scrambles to her feet as Margo approaches with Lloyd from the
direction of the pantry. 

Margo's had too much to drink. Her fake smile fades as Eve
gets up. She's unpleasant and depressed. 

			MARGO
	 Don't get up. And please stop
acting as if I were the queen
mother. 

			EVE
		(hurt)
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

			BILL
		(sharply)
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your
behavior would hardly be considered
either queenly or motherly!

			MARGO
	 You're in a beehive, pal, didn't
you know? We're all busy little
bees, full of stings, making honey
day and night-
(to Eve)
- aren't we, honey?

			KAREN
	 Margo, really...

			MARGO
	 Please don't play governess, Karen,
I haven't your unyielding good
taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe
too but father wouldn't hear of it -
he needed help at the notions
counter...
(to Addison)
I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR
should I say "ain't I"?

			ADDISON
	 You're maudlin and full of self
pity. You're magnificent. 

Max has come up with Miss Caswell's drink. 

			LLOYD
	 How about calling it a night?

			MARGO
	 And you pose as a playwright. A
situation pregnant with
possibilities - and all you can
think of is everybody to go to
sleep...

			BILL
	 It's a good thought. 

			MARGO
	 It won't play. 

			KAREN
	 As a nonprofessional, I think it's
an excellent idea. Undramatic, but
practical...

As she speaks, she makes her way to Lloyd's side. 

			MARGO
	 Happy little housewife...

			BILL
	 Cut it out.

			MARGO
	 This is my house, not a theater! In
my house you're a guest, not a
director-!

			KAREN
	 Then stop being a star - start
treating your guests as your
supporting cast!

			ADDISON
	 Hear, hear...

			LLOYD
	 Now let's not get into a big hassle-

			KAREN 
	 It's about time we did! It's about
time Margo realized that what's
attractive on stage need not
necessarily be attractive off.

			MARGO
		(suddenly)
All right! I'm going to bed.
(to Bill)
You be the host. It's your party.
Happy Birthday, welcome home, and
we-who-are-about-to-die-salute-you.

She starts upstairs.

			BILL
	 Need any help?

			MARGO
		(pauses, smiles)
To put me to bed? Take my clothes
off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn
off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve
would. Wouldn't you, Eve?

			EVE
	 If you'd like. 

			MARGO
	 I wouldn't like. 

She goes up, exits out of sight. A pause. Miss Caswell
reaches up to take the drink out of Max's hand. 

			MAX
	 I forgot I had it. 

			MISS CASWELL
	 I didn't. 

Bill gets up and goes after Margo...

			ADDISON
	 Too bad! We'll miss the third act.
They're going to play it off stage. 

Eve turns away abruptly, in sudden tears. 

			LLOYD
	 Coming?

			KAREN 
	 In a minute...

She crosses to Eve, puts an arm around her. 

			KAREN 
	 You mustn't mind Margo too much,
even if I do...

			EVE
	 But there must be some reason,
something I've done without
knowing...

			KAREN 
	 The reason is Margo and don't try
to figure it out. Einstein
couldn't. 

			EVE
	 If I thought I'd offended her, of
all people-

			KAREN 
	 Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I
know Margo. And every now and then
there is nothing I want to do so
much as to kick her right square in
the pants.

			EVE
		(smiles)
Well - if she's got to pick on
someone, I'd just as soon it was
me.

Karen smiles back. She joins Lloyd and Max. 

			LLOYD
	 Max is going to drop us...

			ADDISON 
	 I've often wondered, Max, why you
bother with a chauffeur and
limousine in New York City.

			MAX
	 In my case it's necessary. Too many
taxi drivers write plays. 

			ADDISON 
	 And too many of them are produced. 

			MISS CASWELL
	 Let's go sit by the piano. 

			ADDISON
	 You have me confused with Dan
Dailey. You go sit by the piano.
(to Eve)
And you come sit by me.
(to the others)
Good night. 

They laugh, say "good night," and start downstairs. As Eve
crosses to Addison:

			EVE
	 Karen...
(Karen pauses)
... you won't forget, will you?
What we talked about before?

			KAREN
		(smiles)
No, Eve, I won't forget...

She follows the men downstairs. CLOSE UP of an old engraving
of Mrs. Siddons as 'The Tragic Muse' which hangs among other
theatrical mementos on the stair wall...

INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT

The applause continues. Margo sits back in her chair now,
picking at a bit of fingernail polish...

			MARGO'S VOICE
	 Bill's welcoming-home-birthday
party... a night to go down in
history. Like the Chicago Fire - or
the Massacre of the Huguenots. Even
before the party started, I could
smell disaster in the air...

INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The same night as the previous sequence, but before the party
has started. Margo is all dressed except for jewelry. She
stands before her dressing table putting it on. She sips at
an enormous Martini...

			MARGO'S VOICE
	 I knew it, I sensed it even as I
finished dressing for that blasted
party...

Birdie comes in. 

			BIRDIE
	 You all put together? 

			MARGO
	 My back's open.
(Birdie goes to work on
it)
Did the extra help get here?

			BIRDIE
	 There's some loose characters
dressed like maids and butlers.
Who'd you call - the William Morris
Agency?

			MARGO
	 You're not being funny, I could get
actors for less. What about the
food? 

			BIRDIE
	 The caterer had to back for hors
d'oeuvres-
(she zips Margo)
Voila. 

			MARGO
		(laughs)
That French ventriloquist taught
you a lot, didn't he?

			BIRDIE
	 There was nothing he didn't know.
(she starts tidying the
room)
There's a message from the
bartender. Does Miss Channing know
we ordered domestic gin by mistake?

			MARGO
	 The only thing I ordered by mistake
is the guests.
(Birdie cackles)
They're domestic, too, and they
don't care what they drink as long
as it burns... where's Bill? He's
late. 

			BIRDIE
	 Late for what?

			MARGO
	 Don't be dense. The party. 

			BIRDIE
	 I ain't dense. And he's been here
t
