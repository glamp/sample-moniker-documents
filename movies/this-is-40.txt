INT. MASTER BATHROOM - DAY

PETE (39) and DEBBIE (39) are having fantastic sex in the
shower. Debbie moans loudly. Pete is strong and sure of
himself. In total control.

                    DEBBIE
          Oh Pete! Oh my god! This is crazy!

                    PETE
          Oh my god. So incredible. Want to
          know a secret? I took a Viagra.

                    DEBBIE
          What?

                    PETE
          I took a Viagra. Those things
          totally work. This is awesome. Why
          don't I use this every day?

                    DEBBIE
          What? What did you do? Wait. Stop.

Debbie gets out of the shower. Pete follows.

                    PETE
          What's the matter?

                    DEBBIE
          You just took a Viagra to have sex
          with me?

                    PETE
          I thought it would make it better.
          It was better. It takes some of the
          pressure off.

                    DEBBIE
          Because you can't get hard without
          a Viagra? Is it because you don't
          think I'm sexy?

                    PETE
          I thought you'd think it was fun
          for me to supersize it for once.

                    DEBBIE
          That is the worst birthday present
          you could ever give someone.

                    PETE
          I was just trying to go turbo for
          your birthday.

                                                           2.

                    PETE (CONT'D)
          My hard-ons are still in analog.
          This shit's digital.

                    DEBBIE
          I don't want a turbo penis. I like
          your medium soft one.

                    PETE
          Look, I can get it up. Just not
          that far up.

                    DEBBIE
          Where did you get this?

                    PETE
          I got it from Barry.

                    DEBBIE
          What? You got it from Barry?

                    PETE
          Why do you care? This is my dick
          we're talking about, not yours.

                    DEBBIE
          We are young people. We don't need
          medication to have sex.

                    PETE
          I only took it because it's your
          birthday. I thought you'd like it.
          Happy fucking fortieth birthday.

                    DEBBIE
          I am not forty! And I don't want to
          have a husband who has to take
          Viagra to get a hard-on.

                    PETE
          I don't have to take it every time,
          but once in a while...

                    DEBBIE
          Fuck forty! Forty can suck my dick.


TITLE UP - THIS IS 40


INT. HALLWAY/SADIE'S ROOM - MORNING

Pete sneaks down the hallway. He kisses SADIE (13) as he
wakes her. She wants to be left alone.
                                                            3.


                    SADIE
          Your breath smells weird.

Pete breathes all over her as he talks.

                    PETE
          Wake up, wake up. Time to get up.


INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - MORNING

Pete lifts a sleeping CHARLOTTE (8) out of bed and walks her
downstairs. It looks ridiculous because she is too tall to
hold her like she is a baby.


INT. BREAKFAST NOOK - MORNING

Pete and the kids set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the
table and decorate the room with birthday balloons,
streamers, etc. Pete sneaks bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts
into his mouth occasionally. The house is a bit more
cluttered and messier than when we last saw it in Knocked Up.


INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING

Debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette.

                    PETE (O.C.)
          We're ready!

She holds her cigarette with a yellow dish washing glove. She
puts out the cigarette and goes through an elaborate routine
of hiding the smell of smoke. She puts some weird oil in her
hair and uses a wet nap on her neck and clothes and brushes
her teeth. She sprays cologne and walks through it.


INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Pete and the kids hold a cake and sing "Happy Birthday" as
Debbie walks in. When they are done she blows out the candles
on the cake which says "Happy 38th Birthday."

                    PETE
          Make a wish!


INT. KITCHEN, TV AREA - MORNING

The kids eat cereal. Sadie watches Lost on her iPad while
Pete and Debbie talk in the kitchen.
                                                4.


                    CHARLOTTE
          Can I watch Lost?

                    SADIE
          You can't handle Lost. It's too
          violent, and you won't understand.

                    CHARLOTTE
          If I don't understand it, why can't
          I handle it?

                    SADIE
          Because you're eight.

                    CHARLOTTE
          I can handle it. I've seen a shark
          eat a guy on Shark Week.

                    SADIE
          Shark Week is fake.

                    CHARLOTTE
          No, it's not.

                    SADIE
          All of it is reenactments.

                    CHARLOTTE
          I know but they--

                    SADIE
          That's scary! You shouldn't be
          allowed to watch that.

                    CHARLOTTE
          --they show the reenactments but
          they actually happened.

                    SADIE
          It's going to give you nightmares.

                    CHARLOTTE
          I can handle a nightmare. You're a
          nightmare every day for me.


INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Pete clears the breakfast dishes.

                    DEBBIE
          Hey. Don't eat that cupcake.
                                                         5.


                      PETE
          What?

                    DEBBIE
          The one you just put into the sink.
          I saw you were hiding that.

                    PETE
          This cupcake? You think I'm going
          to eat this cupcake?

                      DEBBIE
          Yeah.

                    PETE
          I so don't want this cupcake. Look.

He turns on the faucet and pours water on the cupcake.

                    DEBBIE
          You're still going to eat it.

                    PETE
          I'm going to eat this cupcake?

                    DEBBIE
          Just put it in the trash.

                    PETE
          What would you like to do today?
          Your choice.

                      DEBBIE
          Anything?

                    PETE
          Yeah, anything.

                    DEBBIE
          Just hang out with you guys.

                    PETE
          Don't you want to get a massage? Or
          do something fun? Forty's huge.

                    DEBBIE
          I'm turning thirty-eight.

                    PETE
          Okay. Thirty-eight. We'll move on.
          Isn't it weird that our birthday is
          the same week and that we're going
          to have a party, and it's just for
          me?
                                                         6.


                    DEBBIE
          No. I don't think it's weird at
          all. Because you're turning forty
          and I'm turning thirty-eight.

                    PETE
          Come on. Do you really want to be
          one of those ladies who's just so
          insecure about their age and they
          lie and then they've got to
          remember.

                    DEBBIE
          You don't get it. You don't
          understand how it works. I don't
          want to shop at old lady stores. I
          don't want to go to J. Jill and
          Chicos and Ann Taylor Loft. I'm not
          ready yet. I need two more years.

                    PETE
          That is so insane, it kind of makes
          sense.

                    DEBBIE
          What did you get me for my
          birthday?

                    PETE
          I thought you said that we
          shouldn't get each other gifts this
          year?

                    DEBBIE
          What do you mean? You're supposed
          to get me a surprise gift. This is
          a big birthday. I'm turning forty!


INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - MORNING

Charlotte plays the theme from The Office on her keyboard.

                    SADIE (O.C.)
          Mom!!


INT. SADIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sadie tears apart her closet looking for clothes.

                    SADIE
          Mom! Why can't I get new clothes?!
          Nothing fits me!! God damn it!!
                                                          7.


INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Debbie is in workout gear. Pete enters wearing a lycra outfit
with all sorts of logos on it. He is a complete bicycling
asshole.

                    DEBBIE
          I am going to work out. I'll be
          back in about an hour.

                    PETE
          Hey, did your father call to wish
          you a happy birthday?

                    DEBBIE
          No. That's no surprise.

Debbie leaves. Pete picks the soaking wet cupcake out of the
sink and takes a bite.


EXT. SANTA MONICA STAIRS - DAY

Debbie runs up a long flight of stairs with her trainer
JASON. Her friend BARB trails behind.

                     JASON
          Come on.

                     BARB
          Coming.

                    JASON
          You've got to keep up with us,
          sweetheart. That's why your body
          looks like your body and her body
          looks like her body. Before, after.
          Before, after.

                    BARB
          You guys just go on without me. I'm
          just gonna... fuck.


EXT. BRENTWOOD - MORNING

We see Pete in a large group of bikers riding down San
Vicente. Pete's friend BARRY is part of the group.

                     BARRY
          Hey, thanks for letting me join
          this team.
                                                            8.


                    PETE
          It's not really a team, it's just a
          bunch of guys who get together and
          ride.

                    BARRY
          I know, I know.

A car makes a right turn in front of Pete, nearly hitting
him. Pete bangs on the back of the car.

                    PETE
          Bike lane, asshole! It's always the
          guy in the fucking Infiniti.


EXT. STREETS NEAR THE STAIRS - DAY

Debbie is doing sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her
feet down. In the background, Barb stretches on a yoga ball.

                    JASON
          So why on earth is Pete taking
          Viagra? What's going on?

                    DEBBIE
          I don't know. I think maybe he just
          isn't attracted to me anymore.

                    JASON
          That is ridiculous. If you were my
          girlfriend, I would not need a
          Viagra. I would need an anti-Viagra
          pill. To try not to get a boner.

                    DEBBIE
          But everyone gives you a boner.

                    JASON
          Don't sell yourself short like
          that. You give me a boner.
              (whispers)
          Barb doesn't give me a boner.

                    DEBBIE
          Maybe things are just getting
          stale. That's why maybe I work out
          really hard. Maybe he'll be able to
          get a boner again.

                    BARB
          Why do you need to have sex, Deb?
          Sex is the number one thing people
          fight about.
                    (MORE)
                                      9.

          BARB (CONT'D)
You stop having sex, there will be
no more fights. I am living proof.
I have no sex, and I am the
happiest I've ever been.

          JASON
I knew it. I knew you were not
having sex. I can see it on your
face. It's all puckered and pained.

          BARB
I'm enjoying our non-sex period,
that's all I'm saying.

          JASON
Don't you miss it?

          BARB
Well, I wouldn't know, because I
don't have any feeling down there
anymore. I have nerve damage from
my C-section so everything is just
kinda-

          DEBBIE
She's numb down there.

          BARB
I could sit down hard on a fire
hydrant, and I wouldn't even know
that I was sitting. I could get
stung by a hornet down there, and I
would not feel it. You could put
anything in there, and I would not
know what the object was. I used to
pee in a nice stream, and now it
just kind of goes like a shower
head.

          JASON
That is the saddest thing I've ever
heard.

          DEBBIE
I think you need a family. Don't
you want a family?

          JASON
No, I think I want to Clooney it.

          DEBBIE
Clooney it?
                                               10.


                      JASON
          Yup.

                    DEBBIE
          He doesn't seem happy.

                    JASON
          Yeah, he is.

                    DEBBIE
          No. He's lonely.

                    JASON
          No, he's not.

                    DEBBIE
          See, I think he has sad eyes.

                    JASON
          Aw, you sweet little thing. He's
          doing sad, lonely eyes. To get the
          next lady. I can do it too, watch.

Jason demonstrates.

                    DEBBIE
          I bet George Clooney is really
          lonely. Just him and his pig.

                    JASON
          You'd fuck him.

                    DEBBIE
          I wouldn't.

                    JASON
          So would you.

                    BARB
          I would. I wouldn't feel it but-

                    JASON
          You'd fuck him with your numb
          vagina. Yes, you would. Ocean's
          thirteen inches, that's what you'd
          find out.

                    DEBBIE
          Do you think?
                                                        11.


INT. STARBUCKS - MOMENTS LATER

Pete and Barry eat frosted scones, happy to get some alone
time to delay their return home.

                    BARRY
          I mean that was idiotic. You have
          to understand. That's like the one
          thing you don't do is tell her you
          used Viagra. I think that's even on
          the warning label.

                    PETE
          We're in one of those phases where
          everything the other person says
          just annoys the shit out of each
          other. All the time. It's a blast.

                    BARRY
          Don't worry about it. You just
          gotta ride that out.

                     PETE
          This sounds terrible but do you
          ever wonder what it would be like
          if, say, you were separated by
          something bigger, like death. Like
          her death?

                    BARRY
          I have given it a fair amount of
          thought.

                    PETE
          Not in a painful way. Just quietly
          slid into death. Like a gas leak.

                    BARRY
          Absolutely. It has got to be
          peaceful. I mean this is the mother
          of your children.

                    PETE
          I'd want it to be a peaceful --
          just like, drift, into a coma, from
          which she never awakens.

                    BARRY
          Then you move on. Then you're a
          widower.

                    PETE
          That's just it. People love
          widowers.
                                                        12.


                    BARRY
          They love widowers. It's like the
          polar opposite of divorced guys.

                    PETE
          It's the best.

                    BARRY
          It's like, oh, that poor widower.
          You know. If I could only--

                       PETE
          Somehow...

                    BARRY
          ...make him happy.

                    PETE
          Somehow ease his pain.

                    BARRY
          ...cocksuck away his sadness.


INT. CAR - DAY

The family is driving. Sadie watches an episode of Lost on an
iPad. The Pixies play on the stereo, and Pete sings along.

                    PETE
          Did you know that the Pixies did
          this song about a Salvador Dali
          short film called "Un Chien
          Andalou"?

                    DEBBIE
          This music doesn't make people
          happy.

                    PETE
          This song kicks off Doolittle, one
          of the best albums of the last
          thirty years. An important record.

                     DEBBIE
          Look how angry you get while
          listening to this.
              (beat)
          It's my birthday. You don't control
          the radio on my birthday. I control
          the radio on my birthday.

Debbie switches the radio and sings along to "Take On Me" by
Ah-Hah.
                                                        13.


Sadie stares at her iPad. We see a violent scene.

                    CHARLOTTE
          Sadie's watching Lost.

                    DEBBIE
          Sadie, how many times have you
          watched Lost this week?

                    SADIE
          I've only watched eleven. I have
          eight more and then I'm done.

                    PETE
          How many are there?

                    SADIE
          A hundred and fourteen?

                    PETE
          Are you kidding me? You can't watch
          over a hundred episodes of a show
          in five weeks. It'll melt your
          brain.

                    SADIE
          It's not melting my brain, it's
          blowing my mind.

                    DEBBIE
          That's really bad, Sadie. You're
          not allowed to do that.

                    SADIE
          My relationship with Lost is not
          your business. It's extremely
          personal.

Charlotte grabs for Sadie's iPad, then starts trying to lick
her.

                     SADIE (CONT'D)
          Stop it!

                    DEBBIE
          Be nice to your sister. You guys
          are going to cherish each other one
          day.

                    SADIE
          Stop it! Stop!
                                                        14.


EXT. MONTANA AVENUE - DAY

Pete and Debbie get out of the car and walk down the street.

                    PETE
          It's your birthday, you don't need
          to go to the store.

                    DEBBIE
          I know, just five minutes. I think
          Desi and Jodi are fighting.

                    PETE
          All right, five minutes. But then
          I'm pulling you out.


INT. DEBBIE'S STORE - DAY

Pete and Debbie enter and we see their two employees, JODI
and a new, gorgeous employee, DESI, who is up on a ladder.

                    DEBBIE
          Hi. How's Jodi treating you?

                    DESI
          Jodi? Oh, Jodi's my new BFF. She's
          like a little kitty cat. Sometimes
          she comes and rubs up against my
          leg.

                    JODI
          You're a ball of shit.

                    DESI
          She loves me.

                    DEBBIE
          Huh.

Debbie goes behind the register. She looks at Jodi.

                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
          Can you do inventory so that we can
          do the sidewalk sale? And you
          really need to pay attention to the
          numbers because we have twelve
          thousand dollars unaccounted for.

                    JODI
          I think it's probably Desi. She's
          been having a really hard time
          using these simple computers.
                    (MORE)
                                                15.

                    JODI (CONT'D)
          It's because she's stupid. I think
          she might be stealing.

                    DEBBIE
          She's not stealing. She's our best
          employee. She made nine grand last
          month.

                    JODI
          Well, how much did I make?

                    DEBBIE
          You brought in twenty-two hundred.

                    JODI
          That's not bad.

                    DEBBIE
          Well, that's not that good. I mean,
          I'm not comparing you, but you're
          not as good.

Pete is still staring at Desi on the ladder.

                    PETE
              (to Desi)
          All right. See you.

Pete walks over to Debbie.

                     PETE (CONT'D)
          I don't think she's wearing
          underwear.

                    DEBBIE
          What?

                    PETE
          It's all dark up there.

                    DEBBIE
          What? Why are you looking?

                    PETE
          I didn't mean to look, I just said,
          `Hey- woah!' There it was.

                    DEBBIE
          Maybe she's wearing dark underwear.

                    PETE
          Yeah. Maybe she has underwear that
          has a picture of a vagina painted
          on it.
                                                        16.


                    DEBBIE
          Stop looking.

Desi comes down to help a CUSTOMER at the front of the store.

                    DESI
          Maybe some deep oranges and browns
          and maybe dark greens? That would
          really play up your features.

                    CUSTOMER
          I'll just take out my AmEx and you
          pick what stuff you think is good.


EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

We see quick cuts of Debbie playing with the kids on the
trampoline outside. She does a full flip and lands on her
feet. Pete is nowhere to be found.

                    DEBBIE
          Woo! Where's daddy?

                    SADIE
          I think he went to poop.

                      DEBBIE
          Pete!


INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Debbie walks down the hall and into the bathroom without
knocking. Pete is on the toilet playing Scrabble on his iPad.

                    DEBBIE
          What are you doing?

                    PETE
          Going to the bathroom.

                    DEBBIE
          We're all downstairs waiting for
          you. You've been up here for a
          really long time now.

                    PETE
          Oh, I'm almost done. I'll be down
          in a second.
                                      17.


          DEBBIE
Charlotte just did her first flip
on the trampoline, and she landed
on her feet. She was really proud
of herself.

          PETE
Oh, that's great.

          DEBBIE
And you missed it.

          PETE
She'll do it again.

          DEBBIE
It's just that this is the fourth
time you've gone to the bathroom
today.

          PETE
Give me a break.

          DEBBIE
Why is your instinct to escape?

          PETE
It's not my instinct to escape from
you. It is my instinct to come into
the bathroom when I need to go to
the bathroom.

          DEBBIE
How come I don't smell anything?

          PETE
It's because I shoved an Altoid up
my ass before I came in here.

          DEBBIE
Let me see then.

          PETE
What?

          DEBBIE
Let me see!

          PETE
No, I'm not going to let you see.

          DEBBIE
You're not going to let me see
because you're not taking a poop.
                                                        18.


                    PETE
          I've been flushing as I go.

                    DEBBIE
          You're flushing as you go? Who
          takes a half hour to go to the
          bathroom?

                    PETE
              (thinks for a second)
          John Goodman.

She angrily grabs his iPad and walks out.

                    PETE (CONT'D)
          Don't press Enter! I'm not sure I
          want to make that move!


EXT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

A sign outside reads: "Tonight Only: Graham Parker"


INT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - STAGE - NIGHT

Pete stands on stage speaking to a small crowd.

                    PETE
          You know, when I started this
          label, my dream was to work with
          musicians and bands whose music I
          just admired so much. The person
          that I thought, "My god, wouldn't
          it be incredible to work with" was
          Graham Parker. Tonight we have him.
          Solo. Because we couldn't afford to
          fly in The Rumour.

The crowd applauds as Graham Parker (60's) leaps on stage.

Pete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song. The
song is fantastic and personal, but clearly not commercial.

We watch Debbie. Although the music is great, it's a little
depressing and not working on her. She quickly gets bored.


INT. CAR - NIGHT

Pete and Debbie are driving home.

                    DEBBIE
          It's just not my kind of music.
                                                        19.


                    PETE
          Really. What is your kind of music?

                    DEBBIE
          I like Lady Gaga.

                    PETE
          Oh, god, of course you do.

                    DEBBIE
          What?

                    PETE
          Shallow dance music.

                    DEBBIE
          It's not! It's fun, and it's about
          release and sex and power.

                    PETE
          You know, you don't have to like
          it. It's really not for you, that's
          fine.

                    DEBBIE
          This is a job. This is not a hobby.
          Can't you love him just as a hobby?
          And sign a fifteen-year-old hot
          girl so we can eat?

                    PETE
          Graham Parker and The Rumour had
          two albums in the Rolling Stone Top
          500 Best Albums of All Time. Two of
          `em. If I can just sell ten
          thousand records to his hardcore
          fan base, we're golden.

An ambulance drives by, sirens blaring.

                     DEBBIE
              (pause, then laughing)
          The last of Graham Parker's fans
          just died.


INT. SADIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Pete and Debbie walk in mid-argument. Sadie is listening to a
song on her iPhone.

                    DEBBIE
          Sadie. Sadie, what are you
          listening to?
                    (MORE)
                                                        20.

                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
          Okay, this is music that makes
          people happy. And this is what
          people buy. Right, girls?

She puts Sadie's iPod in a dock and plays the Nikki Minaj rap
"Roman's Revenge." They all start rapping along to it.

They all laugh and dance and go crazy. Pete turns the iPod
off.

                    DEBBIE (CONT'D)
          Why did you take it off?

                    PETE
          Now, something that really rocks.

Pete puts on "Rooster" by Alice In Chains.

                    PETE (CONT'D)
          This is called good music. From
          somebody's heart.

                    SADIE
          This is bumming me out. This isn't
          fun.

                    PETE
          Just listen to these words, okay?

                    CHARLOTTE
          I don't understand the words.

                    PETE
          This is lyrics, this is poetry.
          This is what is going to survive in
          a hundred years.

                    DEBBIE
          It just doesn't make people happy.

                    PETE
          It makes me happy. I can dance to
          it.

Pete starts dancing around like it is fun.

                    DEBBIE
          You're the only one in the room
          who's happy.

Pete stops his music.
                                                        21.


                    PETE
          Sometimes, I wish just one of you
          had a dick.

                    CHARLOTTE
          Well, we don't want one.
