A young man's V.O.:

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           I was born in Beaufort, North
Carolina. A place where the air
always smells of pine and salt and
sea.

The voice is gentle. Slightly Southern in inflection.   A
young doctor's soothing manner.


FADE IN:


EXT. COASTAL NORTH CAROLINA (DECEMBER) (PRESENT)

A vast view of the coastline in winter -- beaches, rivers,
sea marshes, inlets -- ebbing and flowing.

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           For many, days and nights are
spent fishing Pamlico Sound or
crabbing the Neuse River.

The CAMERA FINDS a small coastal town, edged by a harbor
on which fishermen toil.


EXT. BEAUFORT, NORTH CAROLINA - MORNING (DECEMBER)

The CAMERA, MOVING inland, CROSSES OVER modest houses
decked with plastic rooftop Santas...

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           While the ocean may be the focus
of daily labor, churches have
always tried to be the focus of
life.

And MOVES UPHILL TO...


EXT. MAIN STREET

Where fake snow is sprayed on store windows. The CAMERA
CONTINUES TO the far side of Main Street -- with its
stately homes with big lawns, flower beds, and tasteful
Christmas garlands.

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           When I lived here, there were
eighteen churches within town
limits alone.



EXT. FOUR-WAY STOP

From each corner, four churches face each other. The
Fellowship Hall Christian Church, the Church of the
Forgiven People, the Church of Sunday Atonement, and All
Saints Church.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          They sponsored pancake breakfasts,
rummage sales, car washes, and
softball games.


EXT. LANDON'S TRUCK - TRAVELING

The CAMERA FINDS and FOLLOWS a newish sport utility
vehicle with MD plates as it passes a rummage sale and a
softball game.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          You'd think that all the people
here were friendly, welcoming,
open-hearted...

Dr. LANDON CARTER, 33, drives the truck.


INT. CAR - TRAVELING

Landon looks urban, prosperous, well-groomed -- but
retains his boyish whimsy and sense of irony. A cell
phone and overnight bag on the seat next to him.

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          ... and that money or family
background or education or luck
didn't matter.

Landon reaches out to adjust his side mirror, revealing a
simple gold wedding band on his left hand.


EXT. STREET - TRAVELING

Landon's truck turns the corner and slows in front of the
huge Southern Baptist church.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          But they did matter. They
mattered to everyone. Except
Jamie Sullivan...

Landon's truck turns into a driveway just past the church
and heads for a cluster of buildings. Behind the
buildings, a cemetery.



EXT. CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The truck pulls up in front of the old parsonage -- it's a
different color than he remembers.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          ... Astronomer. Actress.
Believer in God...

Landon hesitates a moment, then climbs out of his truck.


EXT. OLD PARSONAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Landon heads up the walk and onto the front porch.
Presses the DOORBELL. It RINGS inside. Landon is edgy,
unsettled.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          ... Believer in me.

A nurse opens the door.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH GYM - NIGHT (NOVEMBER, 1985)

ROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as
"Born in the U.S.A." Students hang. Brains, preps,
richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks.
Mixing without mixing. Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted.
A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX.

Missing are the criminals...

A shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up. Stops, TIRES SQUEALING.
VAN HALEN BLASTING. LANDON, 18, at the wheel. He is
impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage
to act on destructive whims. He is envied, copied,
feared.


INT. CAMARO

EMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor. A tiny plastic
skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror.
Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray.

                        LANDON
                 (impatient, edgy)
Where is he? He's supposed to be
here.

                                                (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           ERIC
                    (from back seat)
I need to whizz.

ERIC's skinny, high-energy.          A leg always jiggling.

                             LANDON
             Eric.    You're such a hummingbird.

                              BELINDA
             I wanna dance.

BELINDA is Landon's girlfriend. Richie princess, a bad-
girl pretender. Big shoulder pads. Jellie bracelet.
Swatch watch.

                              LANDON
             So go dance.

                              BELINDA
             With you.

                              LANDON
             I.    Don't.   Dance.

                           ERIC
                    (pointing, like
Tattoo)
Dee plane. Dee plane.

They laugh.       Clay's by the dumpster.


EXT. DUMPSTER

CLAY, obese, wearing a too-small student monitor vest, is
dumping garbage from a trash can. A loud HONK. Clay
turns to see the Camaro, then turns back to the school,
coast clear. He quickly heaves in the empty trash can as
the Camaro pulls up.

Eric pushes a door open.       Empties fall from the back seat.
Clay climbs in.

                              CLAY
             Go go go go.

PRINCIPAL ED KELLY, middle-aged, pockmarked skin, Casio
calculator watch, exits the gym.


INT. CAMARO

Landon's looking at Kelly in the rearview mirror.

                                                      (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
                    (mocking)
Kelly. He looks like his face
caught fire and he tried to put it
out with a fork.

Landon inches the car forward, teasing Clay, teasing
Kelly.

                           ERIC
             He couldn't find his own butt with
both hands at high noon in a hall
of mirrors.

Sniggering laughter.

                           CLAY
             Go!

Landon presses the gas.    The CAR ROARS away.

                           CLAY
             Kelly's so old he --

                           LANDON
             We're done with that already,
bonehead.

Clay smiles, good-natured.    He often misses social cues.


EXT. CAMARO - TRAVELING

Landon drops Clay's student monitor vest out onto the
road. Another car runs it over.


EXT. ROAD

Mr. Kelly walks over, picks up the vest. Shakes it.
Frustrated. Eyes the empty beer bottles by the dumpster.


EXT. OUTSIDE CEMETERY GATE - LITTLE LATER

Camaro is parked on the dirt access road, headlights
shining through the locked rear gate. JOHN COUGAR
MELLENCAMP's "Small Town" playing.


INT. CAMARO

Landon, Clay, and Belinda sit drinking, smoking weed.
Under the MUSIC, a CB RADIO scanner CHATS quietly.

                                                  (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           ERIC (O.S.)
             So which is it?


EXT. CAMARO

Eric finishes taking a leak.

                           ERIC
                    (calling over,
repeating)
Landon. To save your life, you
have to either go deaf or go numb
in your dick and balls.

Eric climbs back in the car.


INT. CAMARO

Landon, Belinda, Clay, Eric.

                             LANDON
             I'm thinking.

                           ERIC
             No thinking. The doctor only
gives you three seconds to
decide --

                           LANDON
             Could I lose one ear and one nut?

                           ERIC
             No questions, no negotiating --

                            BELINDA
                    (to Eric, annoyed)
Where do you get these stupid
questions -- ?

                           LANDON
             Hypotheticals --

                           ERIC
                    (to Belinda)
I'm just wondering --

                             BELINDA
             Don't wonder.

Landon's looking out at the night.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             Jamie Sullivan.

Everyone looks up.     Derisive laughter.


THEIR POV

A pale, contemplative GIRL, 17, is jumping down off the
gate, caught in the headlights. Wearing clothes she
probably made herself; long hair hiding her face. She
lives in her mind, not her body.


BACK TO SCENE

                            BELINDA
             Brain.

                            ERIC
             Bible freak.

                            LANDON
             Cherry.


EXT. CAMARO

JAMIE (GIRL), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and
approaches Landon's window, her SNEAKERS CRUNCHING in the
GRAVEL. She crosses her pilly brown sweater across her
chest.

                           JAMIE
                    (to Landon,
tentative)
Hey. Hi. Your lights. Any
chance you could... turn them
off --

                           BELINDA
                    (leaning over
Landon)
God give you this road?

                            JAMIE
             No --

                           BELINDA
             Then we'll be keeping the lights
on.


                                                (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                            LANDON
                    (to Jamie, seeming
nice)
If you want the lights off, I'll
turn them off.

And he does.    Darkness.

                            JAMIE
             Thank you.   Thank you so very
much.

She backs away from the car, grateful.        From the car:

                           BELINDA (O.S.)
             I can't see a friggin' thing.


INT. CAMARO

Landon switches on the dome lights for Belinda.

                           BELINDA
                    (imitating Jamie)
'Thank you. Thank you so very
much.'

But Landon's looking at Jamie.     Almost counting the
seconds...


HIS POV

Jamie scaling the fence, practiced at it.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon quickly flicks the high beams.     Belinda, Eric, and
Clay snicker and snort as they see --


EXT. CEMETERY GATE

Jamie, startled, paused at the top. But instead of
looking bullied, her face shows determination, humor even.
A moment later, she jumps down on the far side.
Disappears.


INT. CAMARO

Belinda, Eric, Clay are still laughing.       Landon's smiling.

                                                    (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           ERIC
             Ten years. Where're you gonna be?
(to Belinda, mocking)
Hypothetically?

                            BELINDA
             Paris.

                            CLAY
             Dead.

Laughter.

                            LANDON
             Right here.   With you.

He clinks Eric's raised beer. More laughter. But
Landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where
he'd really like to be.

                           CLAY
             'Twilight Zone.' 'One Step
Beyond.' 'Tales from the Dark
Side.'

                           ERIC
             'Twilight Zone,' dipshit.

                           LANDON
             Don't call him a dipshit.

                            ERIC
             You do --

                            LANDON
             And you don't.
(beat, re: Jamie)
What's she doing in there?

                           BELINDA
             Nothing I'd be doing.

Laughter.    Landon kisses her.      With tongue.

A blinding white light dances through the car and settles
on Landon and Belinda's faces.

                            LANDON
             Shit!

He scrambles out of the car.


EXT. CAMARO

Landon looks up at the fence.



LANDON'S POV

Jamie sitting atop, holding a large mirror, reflecting the
headlights back into the car.


BACK TO SCENE

They stare at each other.   His annoyance turns to mild
respect.

The CB RADIO comes to life inside the car.     A GARBLED
TRANSMISSION.

                          BELINDA (O.S.)
          Landon!


INT. CAMARO

Landon leaps in.    Pops out the Van Halen.

                          LANDON
          The address?!

                          ERIC
          York Ave.

Landon pops in a WHAM! tape.     AMPS it UP.   "Freedom."

                          LANDON
          What number?

Nobody answers.

                          LANDON
          Dildoes.

Landon turns the car around.


EXT. ACCESS ROAD

The Camaro fishtails away. TIRES CRUNCHING, red
taillights bouncing on the rough road. The car turns left
onto the paved road and speeds out of sight.


INT. CAMARO

Landon drives recklessly.   Rushing.   He makes a SCREECHING
turn.


LANDON'S POV - STREET AHEAD

Two fire trucks rumbling by houses, SIRENS WAILING.



EXT. CAMARO

Turns right, following the fire trucks.


INT. CAMARO

Landon smiles at Belinda. She smiles back. Fun. Landon
takes a slug of beer. Turns his eyes back to the road.


LANDON'S POV - FIRE TRUCKS

make another turn. Then a flash of light, movement.         A
figure on the road.


EXT. ROAD

An old man walking his little dog.     Crossing the street.


INT. CAMARO - LANDON

turns the wheel hard.      Jams his foot on the brake.


EXT. ROAD

The Camaro swerves.     TIRES SQUEALING.   A LOUD, HEART-
SEARING THUMP.

The old man -- sideswiped, drops to the asphalt.

The CAMARO SLAMS into a light pole.     CRUNCHING METAL.
TINKLING GLASS.


INT. CAMARO

Quiet.   Landon, Eric and Clay are banged up.

                            CLAY
            Christ, man.

                            LANDON
            You okay?

                            ERIC
            Yeah.

Belinda's head leans on the dash. Her shoulders shake.
Landon, bleeding on the forehead, reaches over. Scared.

                            LANDON
            Belinda?

                                                  (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

She lifts her head.     Looks at him.   She's laughing.   He
kicks his door out.


EXT. STREET

The Camaro crumpled into the light pole. Headlights
askew. Clay and Eric and Belinda getting out, dazed.

Landon runs to the old man. Kneels. Shakes him.       No
response. The man's TERRIER BARKS at Landon.


LANDON'S FACE

Frightened, anguished.     The real Landon showing for an
instant.

Police SIRENS WAIL in the b.g., growing LOUDER.


EXT. OLD CHEVETTE - HALF HOUR LATER

A battered Chevette steers through a working-class
neighborhood.


INT. CHEVETTE

Landon's mother, CYNTHIA, 35, drives. She's weary with
sun-worn skin, but still attractive. She wears a skimpy
black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat.

                           CYNTHIA
             What if they expel you?

                           LANDON
             Kelly wouldn't do that.

                            CYNTHIA
             Why not?

                           LANDON
             Cuz nothing happened at school.

He smiles his biggest most reassuring smile.

                           CYNTHIA
             Don't smile at me. It's not going
to get you out of this.

                            LANDON
             Why not?   It always has before.



EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - MONDAY (7:59 AM)

By daylight, a modern brick and glass structure.


INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - 8:05 AM

Mr. Kelly gestures for Landon to sit.   Landon doesn't.
His forehead still shows a bruise.

                        MR. KELLY
          I had hopes for you.

                        LANDON
          Like I'd grow up to be president,
another Reagan.

                        MR. KELLY
                 (not laughing)
Like you'd make it to June. Even
cutting half your classes, you
have a B- average.

                          LANDON
          I'm no dummy.

                          MR. KELLY
          That's right.    You just act like
one.

On his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out
of the Camaro.

                        LANDON
          Those aren't mine.

                        MR.KELLY
          They came from your car.

                        LANDON
          I wasn't the one drinking.

Kelly holds up the police test finding.

                        MR. KELLY
          Your blood alcohol level. Maybe
you were legally in the clear, but
I make the rules here.

Landon scowls, knows he's defeated.

                        LANDON
          You expelling me?

                          MR. KELLY
          I am.

                                               (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             Now I can do what I want.

                           MR. KELLY
             That's right.
(sarcastic)
The world is your oyster.


EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MINUTES LATER

Landon busts out, arms high, fists tight, like a righteous
political prisoner. Freedom. He struts through the
courtyard. Not a care in the world.


EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - HOUR LATER

Landon watches a tow truck lower the crumpled Camaro. A
neighbor kid, JOSH, 12, watches from across the street, on
his way to school.


EXT. CAMARO - MINUTES LATER

Landon pokes and prods his car -- the engine, underneath,
the body, the paint. A discouraging mess.


INT. CARTER HOUSE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Landon knocks on Cynthia's bedroom door.

                            LANDON
             Mom.   I need a ride.


INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM

Dark. She wears a black eye-shield.      Her waitress uniform
hangs over a chair.

                           CYNTHIA
                    (sleepy, annoyed)
I'm not getting up to drive you
somewhere.
(beat)
What're you doing home?


EXT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Landon lifts the garage DOOR.



LANDON'S POV - INSIDE GARAGE

A murky place.   Filled with old tools and junk and a grim
old bike.


EXT. MINI-MALL - AUTO PARTS SHOP - LITTLE LATER

Landon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his
bike. No way to carry. He looks around. The bus stop.
A bus approaching.


EXT. UNDER CAMARO - LATER

BANGING, RATCHETING, CLINKING. Landon's working hard.    A
BOOM BOX playing SIMPLE MINDS' "Alive and Kicking."


LANDON'S POV - HIS MOTHER'S LEGS

and worn terry slippers appear.

                        CYNTHIA (O.S.)
          I want to talk to you.

He pauses, annoyed, then rolls himself out.


EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY

The mangled front bumper's on the ground. Cynthia stands
there in her bathrobe. Upset. Landon's almost too much.

                        CYNTHIA
          You're not hanging round here all
day.

                        LANDON
          I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my
car --

                        CYNTHIA
          You don't need a car you can't
drive for a month. Go see Marvin.

                          LANDON
          'Bout what?

                          CYNTHIA
          About a job.

Landon ignores her.    Slides back under his car.



EXT. UNDER CAMARO

                        CYNTHIA (O.S.)
          He's going to try you as assistant
manager.
(beat)
You could be manager someday.

Landon can't believe this.


EXT. DRIVEWAY

Landon slides back out.

                        LANDON
          I'm not working there.

Cynthia sets her jaw.   He knows that look.


INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - LUNCH HOUR

Landon is sweating, scouring pots. A crooked cap on his
head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt. He's
making some headway; only two more to wash.

MARVIN, the owner, walks over. Beer belly, greasy hair.
Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's
sink. Landon glimpses his future.


INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OUTER OFFICE - EARLY AFTERNOON

Landon paces, jumpy. Kelly's secretary, MISS TARBOX,
quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer.

                        LANDON
          Who's he in with?

                        MISS TARBOX
          He'll be with you when he's
available.

The door to Kelly's office opens. Jamie Sullivan exits
with her father, the tall stern REVEREND HEGBERT SULLIVAN.
Jamie eyes Landon as she passes by.

                        LANDON
                 (joking)
You expelled, too?

Nobody laughs or even smiles.



INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Mr. Kelly makes a note in Jamie's file.

                        MR. KELLY
          Finding the real world to your
liking, Mr. Carter?

                        LANDON
          I want to come back.

                         MR. KELLY
                  (looking up,
surprised)
Back?   Were you ever really here?

They both know Kelly has the upper hand.   Kelly leans back
in his chair, relishing it.

                        LANDON
                 (mumbling)
I want to graduate.

Kelly studies Landon, the boy who can't get out of his own
way.

                        MR. KELLY
                 (thinking aloud)
You could grace our hallowed halls
again, if, while you're here, you
make a sincere effort to be part
of our little school community --

                         LANDON
                 (relieved)
I'd do that --

                        MR. KELLY
          How would you do that, Mr. Carter?

Landon shrugs, clueless.

                        MR. KELLY
                 (smiling)
Shall I give you a few ideas?

                           LANDON
                    (smiling, too)
Please.

                        MR. KELLY
          Besides attending all your regular
classes, I'd like you to help our
janitorial staff after school --

                                                (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                            LANDON
             For pay?

                           MR. KELLY
             For the inner satisfaction it will
bring.
(beat)
Saturday mornings, I'd like you to
tutor disadvantaged students at
our sister school --

                           LANDON
                    (joking)
I'm as underprivileged as they
are --

                           MR. KELLY
             The fact that you attend this
school makes you privileged.

His tone quiets Landon.

                           MR. KELLY
             Finally, I'd like you to join the
drama club. Rehearsals are
Tuesday and Thursday evenings.

                           LANDON
                    (grumbling)
I'd work backstage or something?

                           MR. KELLY
             Or something. They're doing a
play for the holidays.

                           LANDON
             When do I get time for me?

                            MR. KELLY
             You don't.   That's the point.

Landon's not happy, but he'll work with this.     As he heads
for the door:

                           MR. KELLY
                    (softer, trying to
reach him)
Landon, none of us faculty see you
the way you see yourself.
(beat)
Some of us remember how your
father --

                           LANDON
             Then you remember more than I do.



CLOSE ON BROOM

pushing gum wrappers under a radiator.


INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTER SCHOOL

Landon sweeps at the floor during the Star Club open
house. A dozen nerds, including Jamie Sullivan (wearing
her brown sweater), stand at astronomy exhibits. Students
wander in, listen, look.

                        JAMIE
                 (answering question)
-- Saturn's 15 degrees to the
right of red Antares and much
brighter.

To her small audience, she holds up a contraption made
from a wire coat hanger.

                        JAMIE
          This is a very simple device made
from a coat hanger, plastic wrap
and typewriter correction fluid.
Does anyone know what it is?

No one does.

                        LANDON
                 (barely audible)
A star frame.

But Jamie hears.   She regards him a moment, then keeps
going.

                        JAMIE
          This is a star frame.

Clay and Eric enter, checking on Landon, glancing at
Jamie.

                        JAMIE
          A star frame will help you locate
stars and planets with your naked
eye --

                        CLAY
                 (scoffing, setting
her up)
-- Did God create the sun?

                                               (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (taking him seriously)
Yes, God created the universe and
all its physical laws. Even
Einstein said it's a miracle that
our world is comprehensible --

                           ERIC
             -- If God can do all that, why
can't he get you a new sweater?

Landon laughs loudly.    Members of the club look at him.

                           LANDON
             That was a joke. Laugh.

Jamie smiles.    She can laugh at herself.     And she finds
Landon funny.


INT. CARTER KITCHEN - EVENING

Landon washes up while his mother sets the table.      The
MICROWAVE HUMS in the b.g.

                           CYNTHIA
             Your father dropped off an extra
check.

                           LANDON
             I don't want his money.

                           CYNTHIA
             It could help with a new car --

                           LANDON
             -- I like the car I have.

He picks up the envelope with wet hands. Without looking
inside, rips it in half. Cynthia smiles, quietly happy.


INT. SCHOOL BUS - TRAVELING - SATURDAY MORNING

Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing
"Karma Chameleon." Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading,
not singing. She turns around to look at Landon.    He
rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a
Sony Walkman, glum.


HIS POV

To Z.Z. TOP'S "Sleeping Bag." Out the window -- Jefferson
High School coming into view. Bars on every window,
chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass.



INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - LITTLE LATER

A big room with tables and chairs but few books. Pairs of
heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks. Landon sits
with LUIS, a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity. A geometry
text between them.

                        LANDON
                 (reading)
-- 'So what is the measure of
angle x if A and B are similar
triangles?'

Luis is lost, intimidated.

                        LANDON
          Know what 'similar' means?

Luis shrugs. Luis looks down at the book as if for the
answer, then at Landon, hopeless. He gets up and walks
off. Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie
studying him. She's at a nearby table with her student,
ISABEL.


INT. SCHOOL BUS - NOON

The DOOR SWISHES SHUT behind Landon as he hops aboard.
He's late and heads for the rear bench seat.


LANDON'S POV

Jamie sitting there.   And no vacant seats save next to
her.


BACK TO SCENE

The bus begins to roll.   Landon lurches forward.


TRAVELING - LATER

The bus is moving through Beaufort. Landon sits next to
Jamie. Putting a new tape into his Sony Walkman. His
body turned away. She's reading her book.

                        JAMIE
          You going to visit Harold?

Landon scowls.   What-who is she talking about?

                                                  (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             They let him out of the hospital
yesterday. He's in a rest home on
Oak Street.

That old man.

                           JAMIE
             He goes to my father's church.   He
could've died --

                           LANDON
             -- This your idea of small talk?

                           JAMIE
             I don't make small talk --

                              LANDON
             -- Obviously.

                           JAMIE
             I just wanted to tell you not to
give up. Sometimes you've got to
back into the teaching from
somewhere else.

If he heard her, he makes no sign.     She goes back to her
book. A long beat, then:

                            JAMIE
             What makes you volunteer?
(pause)
Want to know why I tutor reading?

Not really.

                           JAMIE
             Because, growing up, books were my
world.

                              LANDON
                     (mean)
Were?

                           JAMIE
             You don't know me.

                           LANDON
             Your book and your brown sweater
and your hair. What's more to
know -- ?

                                                   (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             -- I wear the sweater because I'm
cold. I read because no one talks
to me. My hair is my hair. What
is it exactly that's bothering
you?

                           LANDON
             You don't care what people say?

                           JAMIE
             You mean care what you say? I'm
worrying about other things.

                            LANDON
             Like what?   The moons of Jupiter?

                           JAMIE
             Can't you have a normal
conversation?

                           LANDON
             I don't want to have any
conversation.

                           JAMIE
             Good, cuz talking to you is like
trying to explain red to a blind
person.

She reads again. The bus pulls to a stop in front of
Beaufort High. Belinda, wearing a neck brace, is waiting,
leaning on her Cabriolet. Jamie watches Landon exit the
bus.


JAMIE'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW

Landon greeting Belinda, kissing her.


INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - TUESDAY EVENING

Landon opens a side door, peers in at the Drama Club.


LANDON'S POV

A big space with a stage. MS. GARBER stands before six
geeky boys, and a dozen fat girls and Jamie.



BACK TO SCENE

Landon reacts -- this girl actually chooses to be in these
places? Ms. Garber looks up from her papers.

                        MS. GARBER
          We're waiting, Mr. Carter.

He slides in a row behind the others. Leans forward and
pokes a boy, EDDIE JONES. Eddie's pimply and talks with
his eyes squinched up.

                        LANDON
          What's the play?

Eddie hands him a photocopied script, The Rainmaker.

                        EDDIE
          The-the-there's this drought an'
-- and a smooth t-t-alking guy
comes and says he can m-make
rain --

                        LANDON
          -- And the ugly farmer's daughter
falls for him. I saw the movie.

                         EDDIE
          Yeah.   It's really g-g-good --

                           LANDON
          -- It blows.


ON STAGE - MINUTES LATER

Jamie and Landon sit in folding chairs, reading from
scripts. Landon's wooden, showing how lame this is.

                        LANDON
                 (as Starbuck)
'I hope your dreams come true.'

                        JAMIE
                 (as Lizzie, sad)
'They won't.'

                        LANDON
                 (as Starbuck)
'Believe in yourself and they
will. Let me ask you, Lizzie.
Look in the mirror? Are you
pretty --?'

                                              (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           MS. GARBER
             -- Landon, are you trying to be
bad at this?

                           LANDON
             No, it just comes naturally.

Jamie smiles.    Garber taps her script -- continue.

                           LANDON
                    (as Starbuck)
'It's got to be inside you. Then
one day the mirror will be the
eyes of the man who loves you.
You'll look in that mirror and
you'll be more than pretty.
You'll be beautiful.'

Ms. Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going.

                           LANDON
                    (as Starbuck)
'Look at me. Tell me what you
see!'

As Lizzie, Jamie looks into his eyes.

                           JAMIE
                    (as Lizzie)
'Is it really me?'

                           LANDON
                    (as Starbuck, hamming)
'Yes. You're-you're b-b-
beautiful.'

Hoots and laughter.    Jamie looks away, humiliated.

                           MS. GARBER
             Quiet!
(announcing)
Landon will play the role of Bill
Starbuck.

Groans among the boys.    Jamie is horrified.    So is Landon.

                           LANDON
                    (to Garber)
No way. No thanks. I can't do
it --

                                                  (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                            MR. KELLY (O.S.)
                     (offstage)
-- You can and you will, Mr.
Carter.

Kelly's been standing in the wings.

                           MR. KELLY
                    (warning)
With all the sincerity and dignity
you can muster.

Everyone stares at Landon.     He's trapped.


EXT. AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT EVENING

Raining. Landon exits behind all the others. Stands
under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for
a ride. Jamie approaches, something on her mind.

                           LANDON
                    (rude)
You're like this fly, buzzing
buzzing everywhere --

                           JAMIE
             -- This play means a lot to me.

                            LANDON
                    (snorting)
This play -- ?

                           JAMIE
             -- I know you don't suck at
acting.

Landon laughs. Refusing to take her seriously. Behind
him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night.

                           JAMIE
             But you have to make it a big joke
because only dorks and dweebies
like doing theater --

                           LANDON
             -- What are you going on about?

Pause.

                           JAMIE
             I can judge too.

                                                  (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

He exhales, eyeing her, daring her.

                           JAMIE
             You don't care about classes or
graduating. But you like school
because you're popular and you
know you'll never be on top again.

                              LANDON
             That's deep --

                           JAMIE
             -- Your act only works with an
audience.

                              LANDON
             My act?!

She walks off toward her father's old Pontiac.     The last
car in the parking lot.

Fire trucks rush by on the street below. Landon's ears
twitch. He looks about. No one, no ride. He sees the
Pontiac backing out of a parking spot.


EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past.

                            LANDON
             A ride?!   Please!


INT. PONTIAC

Jamie turns to look at him.


JAMIE'S POV

Landon, wet, desperate, his eyes pleading.

                            LANDON
                    (insincere)
We can talk about your helping me
with my lines.


INT. OLD PONTIAC - TRAVELING - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie's at the wheel.

                                                  (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             I know you don't want help.

                           LANDON
             Then we both know.
(beat)
I'll point. You drive.    Faster.

He points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks.
The wet road glistens.

                           JAMIE
             We're following fire trucks?

                              LANDON
             Yeah.

                              JAMIE
             Why?

                           LANDON
                    (duh)
Because that's where the fire is?

He fishes in his pocket for a tape. Pulls one out.      He's
searching the dash -- no cassette player.

                           LANDON
             Fire is like a living thing.
Wild. Unpredictable.

                              JAMIE
             Like me.

                             LANDON
             No.    Not like you.

She jerks the car across the center lane. Driving on the
wrong side of the road. He grips the dash.

                              LANDON
             What the -- ?!

                           JAMIE
             So you agree you need help?


LANDON'S POV - OUT WINDSHIELD

Headlights looming, a car coming.      Closer and closer.



BACK TO SCENE

                             LANDON
           Yes!

She swings the Pontiac back to the right lane. Smiling.
A car zips by in the other direction, HORN BLARING.

                             JAMIE
           Really?

Landon drops his attitude, his act.   He toys with the
glove compartment knob.

                         LANDON
           Yeah. Kelly'll make me leave
school if I screw up the play.

                         JAMIE
                  (to herself)
28 and 42.

Pause.   He acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested.

                         LANDON
           What's with the friggin numbers?

                         JAMIE
           28 is do something illegal.   42 is
befriend an enemy.
