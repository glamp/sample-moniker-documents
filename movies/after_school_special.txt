                       FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
                           December 21, 2001



     As we wind down the crowded hallway in this typical American
high school...
1A   ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                                1A
     ...we hear all the sounds of a STANDARD PORNO FLICK, from the
unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to the cheesy music.
1B   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY                1B
     The sounds echo in the empty hall. Behind the stage a light
from an open door...
                          MATT (O.S.)
                This is unwatchable. It's not even in
focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is
in the shot. This is really shoddy work.
1C   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM   - DAY                1C
     The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a
TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face.
                          DEACON (O.S.)
                Why do they always show the guy's face?
It's like, can't we just assume he's
enjoying it?
We slowly PULL BACK from the TV.
                          FRED (O.S.)
                Because they're trying to make us feel
like we're better looking than that guy,
so we should be able to get chicks as hot
as her.
                          DEACON (O.S.)
                How the hell do you know?
                          FRED (O.S.)
                It's a basic rule of porno.
Finally, we REVEAL our three heroes: MATT, FRED, and DEACON.
They're watching the porno...
2    INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY                   2
     ... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can
still hear the porno. The three guys are sitting with their
book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage.





                        DEACON (V.O.)
              It all started on my seventeenth birthday
with our usual morning routine: film
appreciation.
The school bell RINGS and Deacon clicks off the TV.
                        FRED
              Deacon! What are you doing? I was
watching that.
                        DEACON
              Come on, let's go. We're going to be
late.
                        DEACON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              And when I say film appreciation, I mean
film duplication. Fred steals them, Matt
copies them, and I sell them.
Matt walks over to the TV and presses eject on five VCR's.
The original plus four copies pop out.
CLOSE ON the original tape: "Ramalot Productions presents
Dirty Darla #7," as Matt hands it to Fred and the copies to
Deacon. They smile.
3   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY                   3
    The guys are waiting in line for lunch.
                        DEACON (V.O.)
              Fred's the kind of kid who's basically
given up on high school. He figures his
glory days are way ahead of him.
                        FRED
              First, I go to Yale, then Harvard law,
then when I'm making a hundred grand a
year, I'll have a whole stable of hot
chicks sitting around topless on my
yacht.
He smiles ears to ear, looking for approval.
                        MATT
                  (to Deacon)
Will that work?
                        DEACON
                  (to Fred)
You are a complete moron.
Deacon and Matt walk off. Fred calls after them.
                        FRED
              What?





4   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     4
    The video monitors up and down the hallways display an image
that reads "Fifteen Days Till Midterms."
Fred sees two AMAZING GIRLS walking towards him.
                        DEACON (V.O.)
              Until that big payday, Fred's sex life
consists of spanking it.
                        AMAZING GIRL
              That test was sooo hard.
That's too much for Fred to take. He adjusts his pants, turns
ninety degrees, and makes a beeline for:
5   INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY                                         5
    Fred looks under the stalls to make sure no one's in there,
then enters a stall and locks the door.
He puts his book bag down, then places a protector on the
toilet seat and sits down. He pulls a large wad of toilet
paper off the roll. Then, from out of the book bag, Fred
pulls a bottle of Moisty-Mate hand lotion. He smiles.
6   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     6
    Fred is walking to class when he spots a HOT GIRL, rubbing a
stain off of her shirt. Another HOT GIRL grabs her arm.
                        HOT GIRL
              We're going to be late. Are you coming?
Fred perks up.
7   INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY                                         7
    Fred walks into the stall and grabs the toilet protector.
                        DEACON (V.O.)
              Fred averages two to five time a day,
depending on how many girls he sees in
the hallway.
8   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     8
    Matt is videotaping the students (including J.T. and Mark)
running down the hallway to class. Fred watches.
                        DEACON (V.O.)
              Now Matt-- Matt's what you'd call a late
bloomer. Secretary of the Audio Visual
Club, amateur filmmaker, and complete
dork.





J.T. and Mark grab Matt's camera and film each other flipping
him off. Matt grabs it back and the Twins walk away laughing.
Fred shakes his head.
                             FRED
                   What are you doing?
                             MATT
                   All great directors start this way. I'm
documenting the essence of high school.
Teenagers running to meet their destiny
only to find it's just home room. It's
very existential.
                             FRED
                   So's my balls. See you later.

9     OMITTED                                                             9

      Matt trudges into the locker room area, holding a towel to
his bloody nose.
                             DEACON (V.O.)
                   In the normal course of things, Matt
probably wouldn't even have been our
friend, but Fred likes having someone to
boss around, and I think Matt's actually
pretty cool once you get to know him.
Just then, the burly GIRLS' SWIM TEAM COACH comes out of the
girls' locker room. She walks by Matt without noticing, and
the door to the locker room closes slowly.
Matt's attention is drawn to it. The door stops with a CREAK,
a sliver of daylight still visible.
Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the
boys' locker room. Then, he stops. He's torn. He's still too
immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be.
He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. He
turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack.
10A   MATT'S POV                                                        10A
      The proverbial jackpot. Teenage girls changing. Bras.
Panties. Towels...
10B   REVERSE ANGLE                                                     10B
      Matt's eyes widen. And then, they CLOSE TIGHT. He quickly
scurries away.
                             DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.)
                   Well, at least he's got the key to the
A/V room.





11   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                   11
     Deacon talks quietly to a DORKY FRESHMAN.
                         DEACON
               Dirty Darla #7 is a modern classic. This
is grade-A porn, my friend. Worth a lot
more than twenty dollars.
                         DORKY FRESHMAN
               Sweet.
He hands him the money and Deacon makes the exchange for the
tape. The freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away.
Deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker. He sees
a gaggle of teenage GIRLS gossiping.
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               People always talk about how tough it is
being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have
to watch one more TV movie about bulimia
or self mutilation or vaginal dryness...
Deacon reaches his locker and opens it. He sees some
CHEERLEADERS bouncing down the hallway. Deacon takes out some
books for class.
                         DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I'll tell you what's really hard. Being a
seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it's
like to have only one thing on your mind
all day, every day, but to have
absolutely no way of getting it.
12   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY                                        12
     CLOSE ON a textbook showing the anatomy of the vagina.
PULL BACK to reveal Deacon, seemingly staring into space, but
really staring at...
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               Testosterone is a drug more powerful than
heroin. I don't really have any evidence
to support that, but the point is, a
horny teenage boy will do almost anything
for even a glimpse of sex.
... his BIOLOGY TEACHER's erect NIPPLES visible through her
conservative bra and blouse. Aside from her flashing
headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even
if you were alone with her on a two-man luge. But that
doesn't matter-- Deacon can't take his eyes off of them.





                         BIOLOGY TEACHER
                   (in the background)
... the increase in the hormone
testosterone causes certain physiological
changes in the adolescent male...
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               We're suffering. Suffering from a deep,
debilitating addiction to something we've
never even had. Teenage boys are like
time bombs, ready to explode.
     BEHIND DEACON
     Two GUYS are whispering.
                         GUY 1
               Did you hear about Rachael?
                         GUY 2
               No, what happened?
                         GUY 1
               John Baldwin nailed her.
Deacon bolts upright and spins around, concerned.
                         DEACON
               Are you talking about Rachael Unger?
                         GUY 1
               Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt's
party. In the bathroom.
                         DEACON
                   (crushed)
You're kidding.
13   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)                        13
     RACHAEL UNGER, Deacon's girlfriend at the time, is naked
under Deacon's sheets after school one day. Deacon ENTERS
from the bathroom and is immediately surprised by her state
of undress.
                         DEACON
               Rachael! What are you doing?
She sits up and strikes a sexy pose.
                         RACHAEL
               We've been together for a year now, and I
thought it was time to take our
relationship to the next level.
Deacon is becoming very nervous.





                         DEACON
               Now?
                         RACHAEL
               You've been talking about this for
months.
                         DEACON
               I didn't think you were listening to me.
Suddenly, Rachael becomes a little self-conscious.
                         RACHAEL
               Don't you want to?
                         DEACON
               Of course I do. But, I, um... I don't
have anything...
She pulls out a condom.
                         RACHAEL
               I do.
But he's still hesitating.
                         RACHAEL (CONT'D)
               Deacon, what's the problem?
Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the
taking. An eternity passes. Then,
                         DEACON
               I have a math test tomorrow.
14   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY (END FLASHBACK)                        14
     The Teacher CLEARS HER THROAT and Deacon snaps out of it. He
turns away from the guys behind him as they continue to
describe the John Baldwin incident.
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               "I have a math test tomorrow." The bottom
line is, I just couldn't do it. I don't
know why, I just couldn't. And I've
cursed myself every day since then.
Deacon is suddenly...
15   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                   15
     ... very depressed as he trudges to his locker. Which is
nothing compared to how he feels when he looks





     DOWN THE HALLWAY
     and sees Rachael at her locker, hugging some people good-bye
(including a good-looking guy who must be JOHN BALDWIN).
Rachael looks down the hallway towards Deacon, but Deacon
ducks away.
Now he's even more embittered.
16   EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY              16
     Fred and Matt are walking towards their bikes after school.
                         FRED
               Did you videotape it?
                         MATT
                   (sarcastically)
Yeah. I took my camera to gym class with
me.
                         FRED
               You are the biggest moron I have ever
known.
Just then, Deacon comes up to them.
                         DEACON
               Hey, guys. Here's the money.
He hands out the proceeds from the operation, and Matt
notices that Deacon is a little out of sorts.
                         MATT
               Something wrong?
Deacon lets out a deep breath.
                         DEACON
               Yeah. I heard Rachael Unger did it with
John Baldwin.
                         FRED
               Well, you had your chance. I told you to
seal that deal.
                          DEACON
               Shut up, Fabio. I don't see you sealing
any deals.
                         FRED
               I'm biding my time.
                         DEACON
               Whatever. It just wasn't good timing.





                    FRED
          It doesn't get any better than that. You
and Rachael were perfect for each other.
And naked girls don't just appear out of
thin air.
(scoffs)
"I have a math test tomorrow."
                     DEACON
          Will you shut up already?
(beat)
Look, I've been thinking about this all
day. We're juniors now. Upperclassmen.
                    MATT
          So?
They reach the bike rack and start unlocking their bikes.
                    DEACON
          So we have a responsibility to ourselves
to start having fun and getting girls.
This year is our year.
(takes the chain off his bike)
There's nothing holding us back any more.
Over in the parking lot, JAKE, a studly senior, revs the
engine on his truck. Two hot girls, KELLY and WENDY, sit on
his bumper, chatting.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          You see? That's exactly what I'm talking
about. That could be us.
                    FRED
          That's not going to be us this year, or
next year, or any year, ever.
                    DEACON
          Why not? All we have to do is follow the
simple lessons of Tony Montana in "Scar
Face."
                    MATT
          Ooh. Good movie.
                    DEACON AND MATT
              (with Cuban accents)
"First you get the money, then you get
the power, then you get the women."
                    FRED
          So, we're going to become Cuban drug
lords?





                           DEACON
                 Listen, the porno pirating operation is
bringing in plenty of money. When I get
my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll
have the power to go wherever we want.
Then, there's nothing stopping us from
getting the girls.
Fred and Matt look at Deacon warily. Is this a plan? Then,
the hot girls and Jake drive past the guys.
                           JAKE
                 Bye, Sphincter!
They laugh, then peel out with the radio blasting.
                           FRED
                 Nothing's going to change, Deacon. You're
still going to be the kid who shit his
pants in fifth grade and no one will ever
let you forget it.
                           DEACON
                 I had a stomach virus, asshole.
Just then, a super hot CHEERLEADER drops her car keys and
bends over to pick them up.
                           FRED
                 Oh, that's just not fair.
Fred adjusts himself.

17   OMITTED                                                            17

     Fred arrives dressed for work (name tag, shirt, etc.) and
waves to RUSS, the scraggly owner of this small video rental
store.
Fred passes J.T., Mark, Wendy, and Kelly and a bunch of other
CUSTOMERS on his way to the back section of the store.
     ADULT SECTION
     Fred makes sure Russ isn't looking and ducks into the porno
section. Hurriedly, he pulls out "Half-Cyborg 5: Final
Showdown" from his book bag. But inside the case is the tape
for "Dirty Darla #7." He makes the switch. Fred sighs a
breath of relief, smiles, and walks out of the adult
section...
     MAIN AREA
     ...right into...





                    RUSS
          Gotcha!
Fred SCREAMS.
                    RUSS (CONT'D)
          I've been watching you.
Russ grabs Fred by the shoulders and throws him up against
the shelf, shaking him with every word.
                    RUSS (CONT'D)
          Those movies aren't for little monkey-
boys!
                    FRED
          Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!
The Customers stop to stare at the scene. Fred breaks free,
and Russ chases after him.
                    RUSS
          Come back here, you bastard!
Russ runs after him and DIVES at Fred's legs, knocking him
and entire shelf of tapes over. The tape FLY EVERYWHERE. Fred
is still SCREAMING.
Russ starts shouting at Fred so that everyone can hear. A
crowd gathers around to watch the spectacle.
                    RUSS (CONT'D)
          What else you got in here?
Russ rips open Fred's bag and pulls out items, looking for
more tapes. Fred tries to stop him, but the old man has an
iron grip and keeps him away.
Fred cringes as Russ exposes porno magazines, kleenex
tissues, baby wipes, the bottle of Moisty-Mate Firming
Lotion, Q-tips, women's sexy underwear, surgical gloves...
Wendy and Kelly are completely grossed out.
                    RUSS (CONT'D)
              (totally confused)
What's this for?
...and a Barbie-type DOLL with a pullstring. Russ pulls it.
                    DOLL
          I'm Candy. Let's play dress-up.
The crowd is now seriously disturbed.
                    MARK
          Dude.





Fred sits there, whimpering on the ground.
19   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY                                         19
     Deacon drives the DMV Tester Car under the watchful eye of
the DMV TESTER.
                         DEACON
               And I signal exactly two hundred feet
before the turn. Rule 108-1.
The unimpressed Tester remains expressionless.
                         DMV TESTER
               Great. Now after the right, I want you to
parallel park in the open space.
Deacon complies.
                         DEACON
               I begin the parallel parking maneuver by
pulling within three feet of the forward
vehicle. I now shift into reverse while
turning the wheel two revolutions
clockwise...
The Tester rubs his brow.
20   INT. DMV - DAY                                                     20

     Deacon's picture is taken. He passed.

     It's dark, but suddenly the lights come on.
                           EVERYONE
               Surprise!
Deacon pretends to be surprised.
                         DEACON
               Wow. This is great.
The room is sparsely populated with a few of Deacon's
RELATIVES, his MOM and DAD, younger brother MAX (14), and
ROGER, a wheelchair-bound nerd with a face full of
orthodontic headgear and braces.
                         MATT
               Were you surprised?





                         DEACON
               Yeah.
                         MATT
               Really?
                         DEACON
               Really. I was.
                         ROGER
               Happy birthday, Deacon. It's Lois Lane
#2. Be careful. It's still in the
wrapper.
He hands Deacon a comic book, still in the plastic bag.
                         DEACON
               Thanks.
23   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - LATER                                       23
     Half-eaten cake and ice cream, unwrapped presents. Matt
videotapes the event.
                         MR. LEWIS
               Are you ready for the big present?
                         DEACON
                   (laying it on thick)
You mean there's more?
Deacon can hardly contain his excitement.
                         MR. LEWIS
               It's in the garage. Come with us.
He follows them, looking back knowingly at Fred and Matt.
24   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)                   24
     The door opens, the lights come on, and Deacon's face drops.
No new car. Instead, several large wrapped boxes. Deacon
halfheartedly rips open the paper.
                         MR. LEWIS
               It's a new computer system. You've been
talking about it for months.
But his Mom can see his expression.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               What? That's not what you wanted?
                         DEACON
               No, it is. It's just--





                         MAX
               I'll take it.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Max!
                         MR. LEWIS
               We can exchange it if it's not the right
one.
                         DEACON
               No, I just thought-- I thought you guys
were buying me that car I wanted.
Max snickers.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               A car? Why do you need a car?
                         MR. LEWIS
               You can ask permission to use our car
whenever you want, champ.
They put their arms around Deacon and smile warmly. Deacon
looks over at his parents' Aerostar Minivan. Everyone moves
back into the house, except Deacon's parents, who linger.
                         MR. LEWIS (CONT'D)
               I told you he didn't want a new computer.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Like you know what anyone in this house
really wants.
25   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     25
     The guys set up the computer. Deacon is really depressed.
                         DEACON
               Now what are we going to do?
                         FRED
               At least you got this great party.
                         MATT
               Actually, we were expecting a lot more
people.
Fred elbows him.
                         MATT (CONT'D)
               What?
                         DEACON
               You invited more people?





                          FRED
                Well, we did send out flyers to like
three hundred people from school.
                          DEACON
                And no one showed up?
                            ROGER
                I did.
Deacon looks back at Roger.
                            DEACON
                Great.
                          ROGER
                Uh, guys. No one showed up because
they're all at Tom Cooperman's house.
He's having a keg party.
                          FRED
                What? Why didn't I hear about this? That
shit's not right.
                          ROGER
                I heard it from Rahim. He beamed me the
411 in study hall.
A beat. Deacon's anger turns to action.
                            DEACON
                Let's go.
                            MATT
                Why?
                          FRED
                Yeah. Tom Cooperman kicked me in the
balls in third grade, and I swear there
is still a footprint on my nutsack.
                          DEACON
                Come on, guys. Can I just get one thing
that I ask for on my goddamn birthday?
                          MATT
                He's got a point.
                          FRED
                Fine. Watch your balls.

      CLOSE ON a set of feet, stomping on a Sony D.D.R. mat.
REVEAL TOM COOPERMAN dancing up a storm, in a heated
competition against several challengers. The CROWD goes wild
at Coop's moves.
The DOORBELL RINGS.
Continuing his dance steps, Coop moves to the door.
26    EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                             26
      Deacon, Fred, and Matt stand on the porch, waiting. The door
opens, and we see Coop dancing all the way to the front door.
                          COOP
                    (ad lib)
Grommets!
                          DEACON
                Hey, Coop. Can we come in?
Coop un-pockets a tiny piece of paper with a thousand names
on it. He examines it for a long time.
                          COOP
                Sorry, son, that dog won't hunt. Y'all
ain't on the list.
He goes to close the door. Deacon stops it with his foot.
Fred flinches.
                          DEACON
                Coop. It's my birthday today, so cut me
some slack, all right?
Coop looks him over, then opens the door.
                          COOP
                    (ad lib)
Well, pickle my turnips, why didn't you
say so? Happy birthday, friend.
The guys look at each other, excited. They look back at
Roger, five feet behind them at the bottom of the steps.
                          ROGER
                Little help?
27    INT. COOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                          27
      People drinking, dancing, couples making out. Girls
everywhere. And over near the keg is...





                    DEACON
              (in a trance)
Oh, my God. There's Naomi.
                    FRED
          She looks good.
And there's NAOMI, every teenage boy's fantasy, wearing a hot
party dress and drinking a cup of beer. Someone lightly bumps
her...
CLOSE ON her lips as the beer dribbles down her chin, and the
world goes still .
She playfully wipes the beer off her moistened lips and chin
with the back of her hand. She turns her head and her hair
floats in the air.
DEACON AND FRED

                    FRED
          She spilled her beer.
                    DEACON
          Yeah.
Fred adjusts his pants. Deacon makes a decision. One that
he'd normally never make.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna go talk to her. What have I got
to lose?
                    FRED
          Your dignity?
                    DEACON
          She's Rachael's friend. It's not like I
don't know her.
                    MATT
          Ask her if she has any unusual hats.
Girls like that.
Deacon gives Matt a dirty look.
THE KEG AREA

          Hey, Naomi.
                    NAOMI
          Happy Birthday, Deacon.





                    DEACON
              (pleasantly surprised)
You remembered.
                    NAOMI
          Well, I got this flyer and--
                    DEACON
          Oh, right. So where's Jake?
                    NAOMI
          Like I care.
                    DEACON
              (hopeful)
So you two aren't going out any more?
                      NAOMI
          Duh.
Deacon's mind is racing with possibilities when:
                      JAKE (O.S.)
          Freakin!
It's Jake, back for another beer.
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Hey, did you hear about Rachael Unger?
Before Deacon can answer...
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          He shoots, he misses, right, ass-
sphincter? Come on, Naomi. We're going in
the pool.
                    NAOMI
          Screw off. I'm talking to Deacon.
                      JAKE
          Whatever.
                      NAOMI
          Whatever.
Jake gives Deacon a dirty look, nods a "let's go" to J.T. and
Mark, and heads out back.
                    NAOMI (CONT'D)
          What an asshole.
As soon as Jake is out of sight, Deacon turns back to Naomi,
but she's already gone, stranding Deacon. What just happened
here?
REVEAL Matt helping Roger drink a beer in the background.





28   EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER                              28
     Deacon wanders out back. It's   very dark and there are several
people in the pool, including   Jake's good-looking friends,
Kelly, Wendy, J.T., and MARK.   It's hard to tell in the dark
water, but it looks like they   might not be wearing any
clothes. Deacon sees this and   starts to walk away.
                         J.T.
               Deacon. I heard it was your birthday.
Come on in the pool, man.
                         DEACON
               No, that's okay.
                         MARK
               No, seriously. It's cool.
                         KELLY
                   (come hither)
Come on, Deacon.
                         WENDY
               Yeah. Come on.
Deacon thinks about it. He takes the metaphorical plunge.
                            DEACON
               All right.
He slips off his shoes and takes off his shirt. He walks over
to the shallow end. Deacon steps in with his shorts still on.
                         MARK
               Dude, what are you doing? Take off your
clothes.
                            DEACON
               What?
                         WENDY
               We're skinny dipping, Deacon.
He hesitates, not sure what to do.
                         DEACON
               Oh. Okay. Sorry, I'll just leave you guys
alone then--
                         KELLY
               --No, come on in. Join us.
Wendy swims into J.T.'s arms. Her shoulders rise above the
water and you can just make out the top of her breast.





DEACON

shorts. He gets into the pool in his underwear, then slips
them off, too, and throws them on the side of pool.
                    DEACON
          Wow. This feels amazing.
Someone splashes Kelly, she giggles, and the other kids swim
around. Kelly swims by Deacon seductively and he smiles.
                    JAKE (O.S.)
          Coop's doing funnels. Come on.
It's Jake, by the side of the pool with Deacon's clothes. The
other people swim to the front, and get out of the pool...
...wearing clothes! Even Wendy, in a strapless bra.
                    J.T.
              (rubbing it in)
Sorry, dude.
                    DEACON
          Hey, give me back my clothes!
                    JAKE
          Freakin? I can't see you. Maybe I need to
turn on the LIGHTS.
And he does. The backyard lights go on illuminating the
scene. Deacon panics. People start looking at him, laughing.
Then, the cheesy colored pool lights come on, flashing
slowly.
Deacon is humiliated. Jake bends down to whisper to Deacon.
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Did you really think Naomi was into you?
Deacon doesn't respond. But it's not enough for Jake. He
picks up Deacon's underwear with a stick and examines them.
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Oh my God! Skid marks. Aaaahhh, Deacon
shit his pants again!
                    DEACON
          No, I didn't! Give them back!
Jake does a victory lap around the pool with Deacon's
underwear on the stick. Everybody is laughing.
                    JAKE
          Sphincter boy shit his pants!





28A   INT. COOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)                             28A
      Jake locks the sliding glass door and waves at Deacon in the
pool. The group laughs and walks away.
29    EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER                               29
      Deacon is still in the pool, shivering and shrivelled.
Finally, the lights turn off in the back yard, and Deacon
ventures out of the pool.
He grabs an inflatable elephant pool toy and slips it around
his privates. He slowly sneaks around the house.
29A   EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - SIDE OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)         29A
      A dog BARKS! He snarls at Deacon standing there wearing only
the pool toy. Deacon runs away into the
29B   EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)                  29B
      The Dog is right behind him. Deacon struggles with him.
                          DEACON
                Hey, watch the nads!
But it's no use. The dog BITES the front of the pool toy and
it starts to deflate...
... just as the HEADLIGHTS of a car pull into the driveway.
Deacon FREEZES. He desperately tries to cover himself with
the rapidly diminishing toy being jerked away by the dog in a
motion that makes it look like Deacon's getting a doggie
hummer. A MAN gets out of the car.

                What the hell kind of sick shit is this?

      The next day, the guys are at the bike rack, when a hot
SPORTS CAR drives by. Deacon is visibly bummed.
                          DEACON
                You know how long it's going to take to
save up for a car selling porno tapes

Fred looks down.
                          DEACON (CONT'D)
                What?
                          FRED
                There's a small problem.

               What?
                         FRED
               I got fired yesterday. Russ caught me and
went berserk. Some sort of sting
operation he's been planning for months.
I don't know.
                         DEACON
               You're kidding me, right? Tell me you're
kidding.
                         FRED
               No. And now I have to work twice a week
at my dad's office. I told you this
Scarface plan was stupid.
                         DEACON
               Great. So now we've got no girls, no car,
and no money.
                         FRED
               And no porn.

               Tony Montana would be very disappointed.
Deacon is once again...

     ... very depressed, as he sits, bored out of his mind in his
biology class.
                         BIOLOGY TEACHER
               Now turn your textbooks to chapter six,
the Animal Kingdom. As you should know by
now, biology is the study of life, in all
its infinite varieties.
Deacon continues to stare at her perpetually hard nipples.
                         BIOLOGY TEACHER (CONT'D)
               So to keep things a little fun around
here, tomorrow we're taking a field trip
to the zoo.
Deacon buries his head in his hands.
32   EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY                  32
     Deacon is talking to the Dorky Freshman near the bike rack.





                    DORKY FRESHMAN
          Is this some kind of extortion racket?
I'll pay you double if you can get me
something today.
                    DEACON
          I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do for
a while. We don't have anything new.
                    DORKY FRESHMAN
          I'm dying. I just need something.
Just then, Naomi walks by on her way to the parking lot.
                    DEACON
          Hey, Naomi. What are you up to?
                    NAOMI
          Going home to cram for midterms.
With a look, Deacon shoos away the freshman dork.
                    DEACON
          Oh. I could help you. I mean, if you
needed any help.
                    NAOMI
          That's okay. I'll be all right.
Deacon searches for something meaningful to say, desperate
not to let the moment pass him by. Naomi cuts him some slack
by asking,
                    NAOMI (CONT'D)
          So where did Rachael go off to?
                    DEACON
          She went to Paris with the French Club.
(then, taking a chance)
We're seeing other people.
She laughs at his attempt at being nonchalant. But she's
laughing with him, not at him, and Deacon can tell the
difference. He relaxes...
                    JAKE (O.S.)
          Hey, sphincter.
... just as Jake drives up to them. Deacon is starting to
really get pissed at Jake ruining the moment with Naomi.
                    DEACON
          Look, can you please stop calling me
that? I think we're old enough to just
let it go. All right?





                         JAKE
               Oh, sure. Sorry about that... Shit-pants.
He looks at Naomi.
                            JAKE (CONT'D)
               Hi, Naomi.
                            NAOMI
               Whatever.
She turns her back to Jake and his smile fades. He revs the
engine and peels out BACKWARDS. Deacon jumps out of the way,
but his bike is CRUSHED by the car.
                         JAKE
               Oops. Sorry.
He shifts gears and drives over the bike again. He laughs as
he drives away. Naomi gives Deacon a pitying look and walks
away. The moment is gone. Now Deacon is...
33   INT. AEROSTAR - DAY                                             33
     ... pissed. His crushed bike is in the back seat.
                         DEACON
                   (emphatic)
Look, mom. I need a car.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               But I thought we agreed--
                         DEACON
               I need a car of my own.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Well, honey. A car is a lot of
responsibility.
                         DEACON
               Jesus, Mom. I'm seventeen now. I think I
can handle it.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Well, it's also a lot of money. I'll tell
you what. Maybe you can get an after
school job to earn money for a car. I'll
talk to your father.
Deacon is stewing.

                         MATT
               Your dad really knows his firewalls.
Deacon bursts into the room.
                         FRED
               Hey, asshole. Don't just come barging in
here. We could have been naked.
Matt gives Fred a look.
                         DEACON
                   (excited)
Shut up. I figured out how to get back on
the Tony Montana track.... So, I'm at the
zoo today...
36   EXT. ZOO - DAY                                                   36
     A crowd of people (including Deacon's biology class) are
watching something in the monkey cage.
                         BIOLOGY TEACHER
               People! People! Come quickly. Witness the
miracle of nature at its most primal.
She's videotaping it, and Deacon looks up AT HER VIDEO
VIEWFINDER. It's a monkey orgy. Masturbation and fornication
everywhere.
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               And these monkeys are doing it. I mean,
they're going wild. And Miss Ariel is
videotaping it.





                         BIOLOGY TEACHER
                   (getting hot and bothered)
With one final thrust of his engorged
penis, the male deposits his seed and
moves on.
(suddenly bitter)
Probably to a younger, more desirable
female. One who doesn't have any
"issues." Whatever that means.
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               That's when it hit me.
Just then, a glob of "something" shoots out towards the crowd
(SFX). Everyone ducks, except for Roger, who's can't move
quickly enough in his wheelchair. It hits him in the face,
dripping down his orthodontia.
                         ROGER
               A little help!
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               Well, Roger actually...
37   INT. FRED'S BEDROOM - DAY                                       37

               What?
                         DEACON
               Let's make one.
                           MATT
               One what?
                           DEACON
               A movie.
                         MATT
               Great! That's perfect! I've already got
an idea for a kind of sci-fi horror
thing. It's like "The Shining" meets "The
Jetsons."
                         DEACON
               No, you moron. A porno film.
Fred lights up.
                         FRED
               Even better.
                         DEACON
               And check this out. The best part of all,
is I've got an angle.





                    FRED
          What kind of angle?
                    DEACON
          We can make pornos that cater to guys
like us.
                    FRED
          You mean virgins.
                    DEACON
          Yes. Adult films made by virgins for
virgins.
                    MATT
          With good cinematography.
                    FRED
          And cute, nice girls. The kind you'd want
to take to dinner with your parents.
                    DEACON
          Right. No shots of sweaty guys' faces.
                    FRED
          And nothing up the butt.
They look at him.
                    FRED (CONT'D)
          What? I don't like it when they put stuff
up their butt.
                    MATT
          These have to be nicely edited. We should
shoot on super 16 and transfer to video.
                     DEACON
          No, Matt. We'll shoot it on your video
camera. We're not getting any expensive
equipment.
                    FRED
          How are we going to get the women to star
in the film?
                    MATT
          And the guys.
                    DEACON
          I don't know. We'll surf the net. We'll
figure it out.
They look at each other for a beat. Finally, Fred and Matt
crack up.





                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          What?
                    FRED
          That was really funny.
Deacon just looks at them, pissed.
                    DEACON
          I'm serious about this.
                    MATT
          We can't make a porno movie.
                    FRED
          Do you have any idea how much trouble
we'd get in?
                    DEACON
          Do you have any idea how much money we'd
make?
A beat.
                    MATT
          Like how much?
                    DEACON
          Enough for a car. Enough for more camera
shit. To take girls out. I don't know.
For whatever we want.
Beat. Beat. Beat. They're thinking about it.
                    FRED
          What about the moral implications?
                    DEACON
          It's a free market transaction between
consenting adults. What's the problem?
                    FRED
          We're not adults.
                    MATT
          He's got a point, Deacon.
                    DEACON
          Guys, tell me the truth. Haven't you ever
wondered... haven't you ever imagined
what it would be like to make one?
                    MATT
          Not really.
Deacon turns to Fred, who looks guilty.





                         FRED
               Okay. Sure. I've thought about it. I've
thought about shaving Principal Taggert's
ass, too.
A look, then Deacon gets up to seal the deal.
                         DEACON
               Look. This is an opportunity we shouldn't
let slip away. If we make this movie, it
could be the best year of our lives.
We'll go in boys and come out men. And at
the end, we'll have the money, the power,
and the women. But you losers would
rather play it safe. Well, I'm not going
to waste another minute. I'm making this
porno movie with or without you. And when
I show up at school in my new set of
wheels, and you two limp dicks are
begging me for my sloppy seconds, I'll
just have to tell you, "Sorry, guys. That
ship has sailed. You blew it."
Ringing silence.
                         MATT
                   (sincerely)
That was a really good speech, Deacon.
                           DEACON
               Thanks.
                         MATT
               Did you work that out before?
                           DEACON
               No, Matt.
                         FRED
               Okay... So say we were to do this. What
would we call our company?
                         MATT
               I've got it. "After School Special."
They look at him. It's perfect.
38   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                                      38
     WE FOLLOW a WOMAN dressed in a Fredericks of Hollywood type
outfit, walking down the hallway past office suites; a
mortgage company, a dentist, etc...
She enters an office. As the door closes behind her, WE SEE
the sign on the door, "Ramalot Productions."





39   INT. VIC'S "STUDIO" - CONTINUOUS                                39
     A small, vertically integrated porno production company.
Blow-ups of the company's box covers on the walls, hundreds
of copies of titles on shelves, a small STAFF and two
adjoining rooms.
VIC RAMALOT, whose face we recognize from Dirty Darla #7,
enters from the set. His partner, MIKE, helps him on with his
robe.
                         MIKE
               That was good. Some good action.
                         VIC
               I've got a question for you Mike, and I
want you to promise to be completely
honest.
                         MIKE
               Sure. Of course, Vic.
Vic looks at him, vulnerable.
                         VIC
               Do you think I'm too fat?
                         MIKE
               Are you kidding? The camera loves you.
                            VIC
               Seriously?
                         MIKE
               Absolutely.
                         VIC
               Thanks, man.
Vic gives Mike a jive hand shake and the two do a little hug.
Over Mike's shoulder, Vic sees the woman who's come into the
office.
                         VIC (CONT'D)
               Darla, sweetheart. Ready for number
eight?
Darla drops her top and heads for the bathroom.
                         DARLA
               Sure, Vic, lemme freshen up first.
                         VIC
                   (to Mike)
Is he in there?
Mike nods, leading Vic through a door, into





40   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                  40
     where there's a terribly FRIGHTENED MAN (cameo for Ron
Jeremy, etc.) tied to a chair with a gag in his mouth.
Vic shakes his head, picking up a pair of rusty hedge
clippers from the table. He snaps them open.
                         VIC
               So, you think you can just walk into my
town and move in on my territory?
The Man takes a quick look down at his own crotch, fearing
the worst. He shakes his head, pleading through his gag.
41   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY                                         41
     The guys are huddled behind the frosted window of Fred's
dad's office, standing away from the RECEPTIONIST.
                         FRED
               We've got to have two forms of i.d. to
prove she's over eighteen.
                         DEACON
               How much money do we need?
                         FRED
               A first time porno actress makes only two
fifty to five hundred bucks.
                         MATT
               That's it? Does that include the sex?
                            DEACON
               Yes, Matt.
                         MATT
               So how do we get women for this movie?
                         FRED
               We place an ad in the Cleveland X-Press
for "body models." That's like some sort
of code word in the industry.
                         MATT
               Are we supposed to have sex with these
women?
                            DEACON
               No, Matt.
A NURSE walks in.
                         NURSE
               Fred, your father wants you to take these
urine samples down to the lab.





                    FRED
          Okay. In a minute.
Fred puts the samples down. She rolls her eyes then leaves.
                    FRED (CONT'D)
          We also need an adult signature to set up
the bank account and the web site.
                    MATT
          Let's use Principal Taggert's name.
                    FRED
          Oh yeah, good idea. That'll never come
back to haunt us.
                    DEACON
          Then whose name should we use?
Just then, MR. GREITZER comes into the office.
                    GREITZER
          I'm Ronald Greitzer here for my 4:00
appointment.
                    RECEPTIONIST
          Okay, Mr. Greitzer. I'll let the doctor
know you're here for your...
(checks the book)
rectal exam. Have a seat.
He leaves and Fred looks at Deacon, mischievously.
                     DEACON
          No way.
                    FRED
          Why not? It's perfect. My dad's got Mr.
Greitzer's signature on file, his credit
card number, and his social security
number...
A beat.
                    DEACON
          And he'll never find out?
                    FRED
          It's not like we're going to send him our
annual report. It'll just be like an
official name of record or something.
                    DEACON
          Okay. Cool.
The Nurse returns.





                          NURSE
                And take these fecal and semen samples,
too.
She hands Fred two more containers, and the guys exit.
41A   EXT. STREET - DAY                                                41A
      The guys ride their bikes towards the lab to deliver the
samples.
                          FRED
                And we need porno names.
                          DEACON
                What do you mean?
                          FRED
                It's a basic rule of porno. All people
affiliated with the production of an
adult film have porno names so their
friends don't recognize them.
                          MATT
                Oh, you mean like "Johnny Hardmember"?
                          FRED
                Exactly. That's a good one. I'll be Balls
McLongcock.
                          MATT
                Ooh, I like it.
                          DEACON
                Guys. Those kind of names are just for
the actors.
                          MATT
                You're just jealous that you don't have a
cool porno name like us.
                          DEACON
                Okay, fine. Then I'm Sam ...
(searching)
Slam. Sam Slam. The Back Door Man.
Matt and Fred look at each other, then Deacon.
                          MATT
                That name sucks.
                          FRED
                You don't get it, do you? A porno name
needs to be a very subtle thing.
Fred gestures and DROPS the samples which SPLATTER all over
the ground.





                         DEACON
               Sorry, Balls. I guess I'm still new at
this.
                         FRED
               Matt, pick that up.
42   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                              42
     The family dinner.
                         MR. LEWIS
               And I'm telling the guy, he's got to use
form ND-45 for a third-party beneficiary,
but Johnson's gotta be the big man.
"We've been using ND-90 for twenty-two
years." But Johnson's an idiot. He
doesn't know ND-90 doesn't even exist
anymore.
Mom yawns. The phone rings and she gets it.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Hello?
(covers phone)
Deacon, it's for you. It's a young lady
named Palomina.
Deacon CHOKES on his food. He gets up quickly and grabs the
phone. Max is eyeballing him, so Deacon walks with the phone
into the other room and talks softly.
                         DEACON
               Yeah. 345 Remson. That's right. Great.
Wednesday, three to five. Looking forward
to working with you, too.
He hangs up and returns to the kitchen to see the whole
family staring at him, curious.
                         DEACON (CONT'D)
               I'm tutoring someone ... in math. To earn
money for a car.
He forces a smile.
43   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY                                        43
     The guys are busy setting up auditions.
                         DEACON
               No, we don't pay bus fare.
                                                         JUMP CUT TO:





                          FRED
               Sure, you can bring your dog.
(beat)
Oh. No, that's okay. Better leave him
home.
                                                       JUMP CUT TO:

               Thanks. You sound sexy, too.
                                                       JUMP CUT TO:
     The guys are getting excited.
                         FRED
               I can't believe this is working.
44   INT. BASEMENT SET - OTHER ROOM - DAY                             44
     And there's Matt, wearing a shirt and tie, nervously sitting
in the rec room with a room full of CRACK WHORES.
They're a motley crew of fat, old, toothless, spandex-wearing
streetwalkers (including one TRANSVESTITE).
An uncomfortable silence pervades the room. Matt turns to one
woman wearing a rainbow-colored halter top.
                          MATT
               When you have sex with a strange man, do
you imagine it's like your boyfriend or
something?
She just looks at him.
                         DEACON (O.S.)
                   (over a walkie talkie)
We're ready. Over.
Matt picks up his walkie talkie.
                         MATT
               Roger. Over.
He looks at his clipboard and turns to the first woman.
                         MATT (CONT'D)
               You can go in now.
She gets up and walks through the curtain.





45   INT. DEACON'S BASEMENT - DAY                                    45
     The basement is set up with a casting couch. Fred and Deacon
are also dressed in jackets and ties. The Crack Whore makes
her way over to them. They stare at her, slackjawed.
                         DEACON
               Take a seat please.
                         FRED
               Hi, I'm Balls McLongcock and this is Sam
Slam.
                         CRACK WHORE
               Tequila. You boys seem kind of young.
                         DEACON
               Don't worry. We're old enough.
                         FRED
               Tequila. Nice name. So, have you done any
films before?
                         CRACK WHORE
               I been in some home movies. Stuff like
that. Some pictures.
She tosses a stack of Polaroids at them. The top one has her
standing next to a horse. Fred is speechless.
                         DEACON
               Okay, then. I think we have what we need.
We'll call you.
She's confused.
                         CRACK WHORE
               So you don't want me to suck you two off?
They look at each other.
                         DEACON
               No, I don't think that will be necessary
at this time.
                         FRED
               Maybe later.
46   INT. DEACON'S BASEMENT - LATER                                  46
     The whores are gone.
                         MATT
               Maybe if we put another ad in and say
we're only looking for good looking
models.





They look at him with disdain.
                         FRED
               There's got to be another way to recruit
porno actresses.
47   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     47

     Three digital images of the guys are lined up on Deacon's
computer monitor (thanks Mom and Dad!). Deacon is digitally
altering the photo of Fred to give him a goatee. Matt's photo
has already gotten mutton chops and Deacon's looking sweet
with a fu-manchu.
                         DEACON
               I say we make them from Hawaii.
                          MATT
               Hawaii?
                         DEACON
               It's perfect. Do you know what a Hawaii
driver's license looks like?
                          MATT
               No.
                          DEACON
               Exactly.
                         FRED
               But isn't it going to seem a little
suspicious? Like why are we in Cleveland?
                          DEACON
               Vacation. People from Cleveland vacation
in Hawaii, where do you think people from
Hawaii go?
Matt and Fred look at each other. They shrug, then,
                          MATT
               Aloha.
48   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT                         48
     The next night. The three guys walk downstairs dressed in
Hawaiian shirts. Deacon's parents are reading and Max is
watching TV.
                         DEACON
               Hey, mom. Can I borrow the car?
                         MRS. LEWIS
               I have to go to the video store later.





                          DEACON
                But, mom. You said I could use the car,
but it's never free.
                          MRS. LEWIS
                All right, Deacon. I'll walk to the
store.
                          MAX
                Where are you guys going?
                            DEACON
                Out.
                          MR. LEWIS
                Why are you boys dressed like Don Ho?
                          FRED
                This is the new style, Mr. Lewis.
                          MAX
                Yeah, for ass-wranglers.
                            MRS. LEWIS
                Max!
49    INT. AEROSTAR - NIGHT                                               49
      Inside the car (still in the garage), the three guys apply
their fake facial hair to match their three new fake i.d.'s.
                          FRED
                Are we really going to do this?
                            DEACON
                Oh, yeah.
He starts the ignition, and an EASY LISTENING tune blasts on
the radio, ruining the moment. The guys look at each other
for a beat, then Deacon quickly changes the station to a
ROCKING SONG, and get back into the mood for adventure.
                          DEACON (CONT'D)
                    (once again)
Oh, yeah.
They pull out and drive off.
49A   EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT                                             49A
      The minivan descends out of the suburbs into the lights of
the big city below.
50    EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT                                  50
      CLOSE ON the Aerostar's bumper sticker: "My child is on the
honor roll at William Wall High School."





The guys step out of the car and see for the first time the
Holy Grail of boyhood fantasies: the neon outline of a
topless woman at the entrance to this upscale strip club.
They stop and stare for a beat, before finally getting up the
nerve to walk up to a menacing BOUNCER sitting on a stool
outside the entrance, reading "The Princess Diaries."
                      BOUNCER
            I.d.'s.
They confidently pull out the i.d.'s and hand them over.
                      BOUNCER (CONT'D)
            Richard Runningbear from Hawaii? What
brings you guys to Cleveland?
              FRED                             MATT


                      DEACON
            We're on business, he's on vacation.
He hands the i.d.'s back.
                      BOUNCER
            Well, "tiki-alohi-noa-lohi."
                      DEACON
            Sorry?
                      BOUNCER
            That's Hawaiian for "welcome."
                      FRED
            Right. Of course. We just moved to Hawaii
a few months ago. Haven't picked up the
local lingo yet.
They force smiles and wait for the answer...
                      BOUNCER
            Okay. Have a good time, guys.
Deacon grabs the i.d.'s and pushes the other two forward. He
grabs the handle to the door.
                       BOUNCER (CONT'D)
            Oh, and guys.
(beat)
Nice lamination job.
                      FRED
            Thanks!
The Bouncer closes the door on them. Busted.





                         DEACON
               Look. We have to get into this strip bar.
                         MATT
               The next two years of high school depend
on it.
                         BOUNCER
               How old are you guys?
                         DEACON
               Twenty-seven.
                         FRED
               Thirty-five.
                          MATT
               Sixteen.
Fred smacks him.
                         BOUNCER
               Sorry, guys.
Then,
                         DEACON
               We've got money.
Deacon pulls out a wad of cash. The Bouncer looks around,
then thinks about it for a second.
51   INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT                                51
     WE TRACK the guys as they slowly move down the dark corridor
towards the light. Each guy is in his own little world, Matt
and Fred following Deacon as he takes the first nervous
steps.
First the neon lights hit them, then the smell of liquor and
sweat, the sounds of barroom chatter, and finally the
grinding blast of MUSIC, so powerful it seems to stop them in
their tracks. Their eyes bug out.
SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS walking by. As they move further into
the club, they see actual STRIPPERS soliciting lap dances and
some TOPLESS DANCERS onstage. Fred smiles ear to ear.
The guys are locked in a deep primordial trance, broken only
by the voice of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS.
                         COCKTAIL WAITRESS
               What'll you boys have? Two drink minimum.
                         FRED
               Huh? Oh. I'll have a scotch. Straight up.
On the rocks.





She looks at him like he's an idiot.
                    MATT
          I'll have a seven and seven.
                      DEACON
          Uh, same.
She leaves.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          What's a seven and seven?
                    MATT
          I don't know. But I heard that guy over
there order one and I like the way it
sounds. Numerical.
The Waitress comes back with their drinks. He pays her and
then they raise their glasses.
                    DEACON
          To After School Special.
                    MATT AND FRED
          To After School Special.
They drink. And CHOKE.
                    MATT
          It tastes like poison.
A beautiful STRIPPER in an American flag bikini approaches.
                    AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
          Are you boys interested in a dance?
They look at each other.
                      FRED
          Okay?
She takes Fred's hand and walks him over to a private dance
couch. As the next SONG starts, a curtain lowers around Fred
and the Stripper. Fred is a little freaked out.
IN SILHOUETTE

She rubs up and down Fred's body, shaking her hair in his
face. Matt and Deacon watch intently.
                      MATT
          Cool.
BACK TO SCENE





The song ends, the curtain comes up, and Fred is smiling ear
to ear. The Stripper gets dressed and Fred pays her.
                    AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
          You want another dance?
                    FRED
          Uh, not right now, thank you. I have to
go to the bathroom.
He tries to get up, but the Stripper stop him.
                    AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
          Well how about you buy me a drink?
                      FRED
          Okay.
She sits down on Fred's lap. Right on his boner.
                      FRED (CONT'D)
          Uhhhhh.
                    AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
              (to the waitress)
Seven and seven.
                    MATT
          You want mine?
She laughs.
                    AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
          So what brings you boys to the Pretty
Kitty?
                    MATT
          We're from Hawaii.
                    DEACON
          Actually, we're filmmakers. We're here
looking for new talent.
                      AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
          Really?
                    DEACON
          Yeah, we're looking for some beautiful
ladies looking to break into film. You
interested?
                      AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
          No.
They look defeated.





                          AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER (CONT'D)
                But I know someone who is.
A beat, then time stands still once more for our heroes as
ASHLEY makes her entrance. She looks barely legal, dressed in
a Catholic school girl outfit, and walks up to them.
                          ASHLEY
                Hi, I'm Ashley. You guys are filmmakers?
                          MATT
                Video actually. They won't let me shoot
on film.
Deacon pulls out his wad of cash.
                          DEACON
                Look. We're paying top dollar, hetero
only, no anal, and we're distributing
through our web site.
                          ASHLEY
                Aren't you kind of young?
                          DEACON
                Aren't you? You know we're going to need
two forms of i.d. to prove you're over
eighteen.
                          ASHLEY
                I'm eighteen. Don't worry.
                          FRED
                Then you're hired.
                          MATT
                Shouldn't we audition her first?
                          ASHLEY
                Don't worry. You guys relax and have a
few drinks. By the time the night's over,
you'll know I'm your girl.
      STRIP CLUB MONTAGE:

      - Ashley slinks through the fog onstage and works the pole
like good girl should: gentle but firm.
- Various other Strippers (a Swedish stripper named PLANTAIN,
the American Flag Stripper, a BLACK STRIPPER, and an EXOTIC
STRIPPER) give the three guys lap dances, dance on the
carousel, and generally suck up to them.
- The guys are pounding drinks like there's no tomorrow.





- Fred is nuzzling between Plantain's assets.
- Deacon licks the Exotic Stripper's salty neck and downs a
tequila shot.
- The three guys are all on the bar now, doing a
choreographed dance routine, and stripping to their
underwear.

one stripper. She whips some ice cream at him. Food fight!
51E   EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - DAWN                                         51E
      - Ashley is dropping the guys off back at Deacon's house in
the Aerostar. She writes down her information on a picture of
herself. There's a car full of Strippers waiting for her.
- Just then, Jake pulls into the driveway next door. He sees
the Strippers and the guys.
      END MONTAGE.

      A LADY dressed in sexy clothes and eating chicken wings from
a huge bucket is waiting around on the set, but Vic is over
talking to Mike.
                          VIC
                Someone's been recruiting new talent.
                          MIKE
                Jimmy Rimmer says they're from Hawaii.
                          VIC
                Why the hell would someone from Hawaii
come to Cleveland?





                    MIKE
          Vacation? There's the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame.
Vic thinks it over.
                    VIC
          That's true.
Vic regains his train of thought.
                    VIC (CONT'D)
          What is this? "F" with Vic month? If any
more amateurs start moving in on my
territory, I'm going to get really mad.
Vic opens the drawer and pulls out a GUN. He cocks it
menacingly.
                    MIKE
          Who you gonna shoot?
Vic's bluff has been called. Reluctantly,
                    VIC
          I don't know.
                    MIKE
          Calm down, Vic. I don't need you all
agitated. You still got five films to
star in today.
                    VIC
          You're right, Mikey.
Mike takes the gun from Vic and puts it away.
                    MIKE
          Don't worry. I'll find these guys and
take care of it.
Vic cheers up a bit.
                    VIC
          You hungry?
                    MIKE
          Yeah, I could eat.
                    VIC
          Grab some lunch?
                    MIKE
          Yeah, okay.
The two head out for lunch, leaving the bondage lady sitting
there, confused.





53   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY                                     53
     Deacon wakes up sick as a dog. All the shades are drawn, but
Fred and Matt are already hard at work on the computer. They
seem completely fine, with no signs of Deacon's hangover.
                         DEACON
               What are you guys doing?
                         FRED
               We came up with a great idea. We're going
to presell the videos by posting the
scripts on the website.
                         DEACON
               Will that work?
                         MATT
               I don't know. But it's kind of fun. We
just wrote this whole thing about the
girls' locker room.
                         FRED
               One thing, though. If our motto is "by
virgins, for virgins," I was thinking we
should put a picture of one of us on the
web site to sort of sell the image.
                         MATT
               You're not putting my picture up there.
                         DEACON
               It doesn't really have to be one of us,
though, does it?
He grabs the yearbook.
     INSERT:
     ROGER'S FACE, as Balls McLongcock, proudly displayed on the
web site, hawking the first feature film (coming soon) of
After School Special with the motto, "By Virgins, For
Virgins."
A quick knock on the door and Deacon's Mom comes in.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Deacon, look who's here. Your friend,
Jake.
Jake enters, all smiles.
                           JAKE
               Hi, guys.
Fred quickly shuts off the monitor.





                    MRS. LEWIS
          You kids have fun.
And she leaves.
                    JAKE
          What the hell's going on, Sphincter?
                    DEACON
          What are you doing here?
                    JAKE
          I saw the strippers. And some crack whore
named Saffron came over my house the
other day looking for you guys.
                    FRED
          We don't know what you're talking about.
Jake takes some pages off the printer.
                    JAKE
          What's this? "Oh, my God. There's a boy
at the door looking at us naked in the
shower."
He flips a page.
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          "The A/V Club Secretary lathers all of
their glistening bodies. 'I'm so dirty,'
she moans." What the hell kind of crap is
this? Are you guys running a whorehouse
or something?
                    DEACON
          No.
                    FRED
          Are you crazy?
                    MATT
          They're not whores if we film them, you
moron.
Deacon can't believe Matt just blew it. Fred smacks him.
                    JAKE
          You retards are making a porno movie?
                    DEACON
          You can't prove anything.
                    JAKE
          Who's the girl?





                           MATT
                 A stripper. Her name's Ashley.
He pulls out Ashley's picture from his manila folder. Jake
checks it out. His eyes go wide and suddenly he's their new
best friend.
                           JAKE
                 Who's the guy?
A beat.
                           JAKE (CONT'D)
                 Well, maybe I could do it.
                           DEACON
                 No, that's not a good idea.
                              JAKE
                 Why not?
                           FRED
                 It's a lot harder than it looks.
                           JAKE
                 You don't think I can do it? Trust me,
I've nailed enough girls.
                              DEACON
                 Forget it.
                           JAKE
                 Look, you little butt munch. I want to do
this, and if you don't let me, I'll go
and tell your mommy what kind of sick
shit you're doing.
Jake looks him over.
54   INT. BASEMENT SET AS "YEARBOOK OFFICE" - DAY                    54

     Click. The lights come on. The big day has come at last. The
guys are nervously conferring on one side of the room, far
away from Ashley, who's standing alone, dressed in a
conservative high school girl's outfit.
The basement has been transformed into the guys' idea of a
movie set, complete with lights, camera, tripod, and sound
equipment. A desk and decoration make the room look roughly
like the high school yearbook offices.
Deacon gives Matt a little shove, and Matt takes a long walk
over to Ashley.





                    MATT
          So, um, I'll be directing.
                    ASHLEY
          Okay.
                    MATT
          Okay. So I want you to play this very
understated. It's a very visceral scene,
so it's important not to play it too over
the top.
                     ASHLEY
          Uh huh.
(beat)
Hey, did you guys shave or something?
Deacon looks at the other two, all three now beardless.
                    DEACON
          Okay. I think we're ready here.
Fred awkwardly picks up the boom and puts his earphones on.
                    MATT
          Boom in position.
                    FRED
          What?
Deacon pushes him over to position.
                    MATT
          Ashley, get into position.
Matt gets behind the camera. They whisper conspiratorially.
One last reality check before they take the leap.
                    FRED
          Are we actually going to do this?
They look over at Ashley. She's waiting.
                    DEACON
          I guess so.
They return to position.
                    MATT
          So, um, we're starting with the
masturbation and then Phillip, the
yearbook editor, is going to surprise
you.
                    ASHLEY
          Okay.





                          MATT
                And ... action.
                          ASHLEY
                    (wooden)
These yearbook photos of the Debate Club
are making me so hot. I can't help
myself.
THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY, Ashley slowly strips off her
clothes. But before we get too good a look, we
      REVERSE ANGLE
      FRED smiles ear to ear.
DEACON gulps.
MATT peers out from behind the camera.
                          ASHLEY (O.S.)
                I hope no one catches me because I forgot
to lock the door. Oh, yeah. Oh, God,
yeah.
FRED's smile turns into nervous ogling.
DEACON crosses his legs and adjusts his shorts.
MATT wipes a bead of sweat from his brow.
Deacon whispers,
                            DEACON
                Close up.
                            MATT
                What?
                            DEACON
                Close up.
                          MATT
                Oh yeah. Right.
And Matt zooms in. Ashley continues moaning and as Matt gets
closer, the camera starts shaking. He can't keep his hands
steady.
54A   THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY                                       54A
      We'd love to get a look, but the camera is shaking so much,
it's just a BLUR.





54B   REVERSE ANGLE                                                   54B

                Oh! Oh! Oh!
                             MATT
                Okay, CUT!
She turns off her performance like a light switch.
                          ASHLEY
                What? Did I so something wrong?
Matt is quivering.
                          MATT
                Uh, no. You were great. I think I've got
what I need there. I want to set up for
Jake.
                          FRED
                I need a bathroom break.
                          DEACON
                Not now, Fred. Jake.
Jake comes out of the bathroom dressed as the yearbook
editor.
                             MATT
                Action.
Jake opens a makeshift door to the office.
                          JAKE
                    (wooden)
Oh, my God. What are you doing?
                          ASHLEY
                I couldn't help myself. Please don't tell
the principal.
                          JAKE
                Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.
                          MATT
                Cut. Perfect. Okay, then. Let's get to
the, uh, sexual material.
Jake pulls off his pants and starts to look a little nervous.
He stands in the corner, trying to psyche himself up.
                          DEACON
                Jake, you okay?
                          JAKE
                Sure. No problem.





                    MATT
          And ACTION!
But Jake is still standing there, not in the shot. He's
starting to sweat.
                    MATT (CONT'D)
          Action, Jake.
                       JAKE
          Okay.
Still nothing.
                    DEACON
          Come on, Jake. We're filming.
                    JAKE
          All right. Hang on a second.
He has his back to them, but it's obvious his bread hasn't
risen. Fred lets the boom mike sag a bit.
                    FRED
          My arm's getting tired.
                       ASHLEY
          So's his.
                       MATT
          Action...
Jake finally whips off his underwear and faces Ashley.
                       ASHLEY
          That's it?
                    JAKE
          Hey, it's not hard yet.
                    ASHLEY
          I can see that.
Fred snickers and Jake gives him the evil eye.
                    DEACON
          Um, okay. Ashley, maybe you can help him
out.
She grabs his joint and Jake freezes. He remains motionless,
focusing every ounce of mental control on keeping the
floodgates closed. Approximately one point three seconds
later...
                       ASHLEY
          Aaaahhhh!





                    MATT
          Wait! I'm not set up for that shot!
                    FRED
          Can I put down the boom?
                    DEACON
          Jake? What's happened?
Jake, humiliated, runs to put on his shorts.
                    JAKE
          This has never happened before. She got
me too excited.
                    ASHLEY
          Me? How did you ... without even getting
hard first?
                    JAKE
              (copping an attitude)
What do you want to hear? I've got a tiny
pee-pee? I'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor?
Sometimes before I get a boner? Okay?
                    DEACON
          Calm down, Jake. We can shoot this scene
again. Just relax. We can splice it
together.
                    MATT
          We'd have to do it like twenty times to
get enough footage.
                    JAKE
          I'm out of here. And if you dickwads tell
anybody about this, first I'll kill you,
and then I'll bust you guys.
He pops the videotape out of the camera, takes it, and
leaves.
                      ASHLEY
          Now what?
The guys regroup, away from Ashley. The moment of truth: How
far are they willing to go?
                    MATT
          Deacon. You do it.
                      DEACON
          No way.
                    MATT
          Come on. This is your big chance.





                    DEACON
          No. You do it.
A beat.
                     MATT
          Fred.
                     FRED
          What?
                     MATT
          Come on.
                     FRED
          You.
                    MATT
          I have to run the camera.
                    FRED
          Oh, like you're the only one who can do
that.
                    MATT
              (false bravado)
Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it for the sake
of the film. Hold this.
He hands the camera to Deacon and starts taking off his
shirt. The rest of them look at Matt with his shirt off.
                    DEACON
          Matt. Stop it.
                    MATT
          No, I'll do it.
He desperately wants someone to hold him back.
                    FRED
              (grabs him)
Matt!
They huddle again, worried about whether to go on with this.
                    FRED (CONT'D)
          Look, guys. Maybe we should just pay
Ashley and chalk this up to a failed
experiment.
                    MATT
          Fine with me.
                    DEACON
          No. We can get someone else.





                           FRED
               Who?
                                                              CUT TO:

     CLOSE ON the cover of "T
reveal a twenty-something MAN thumbing through the issue.
     REVEAL
     Deacon, standing a little too close to him.
                         DEACON
                   (nonchalant)
Good issue.
Beat.
                         DEACON (CONT'D)
               You ever think about getting into film?
Way uncomfortable, the guy puts the magazine down and makes a
beeline for the door.
                         DEACON (CONT'D)
               Where are you going, man?
The guy is out the door. Deacon...
56   EXT. JIM'S TINY MART - NIGHT                                       56
     ... runs after him.
                         DEACON
               Don't you want to get it on with a sexy
lady?!?
Matt and Fred are sitting on the curb with some slurpies,
bummed.
                         MATT
               And that guy had real screen presence,
too.
Just then, Coop pulls up in his van and gets out.
                         COOP
               Hey, dudes.
The guys look at each other...
                                                         JUMP CUT TO:

      Fred and Matt are huddled around the computer.
                          FRED
                Oh, I've got it. What if the Math Team

she's going to get grounded if she fails
one more test...
As they talk, Fred types away.

      Deacon and his biology class are getting on a school bus.
Nearby, Naomi is crossing the parking lot when she trips and
spills her latt on her shirt. People start laughing, but
Deacon instinctively rushes over to pick up her books.
                          DEACON
                Are you okay?
                          NAOMI
                Yeah. Thanks. I'm so embarrassed.
She pats at the stain.
                          DEACON
                    (genuine)
Really? I didn't think you got
embarrassed about anything.
She smiles at Deacon, cheered up by the inadvertent
compliment. The Bus HONKS for Deacon.
                          DEACON (CONT'D)
                Well, I guess I should go.





He turns to walk away, when Naomi makes a decision to give
Deacon a shot.
                          NAOMI
                Deacon, wait. Block me for a second while
I change my shirt.
                            DEACON
                What?
                          NAOMI
                Facing the other way.
                            DEACON
                Oh.
He turns around and she changes her shirt behind him. Deacon
can't help but sneak a peek.
                          NAOMI
                I haven't seen you around here in a
while.
                          DEACON
                Yeah, I'm working on this project at
home.
                          NAOMI
                Cool. You can turn around now.
He turns and sees her new shirt is not yet 100% on.
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
                Listen. Mark and J.T. are having a party
tonight. You want to meet me there?
                            DEACON
                Really?
                            NAOMI
                Why not?
                          DEACON
                Okay. Cool.
The bus HONKS for Deacon again.
65    EXT. AQUARIUM PARK - DAY                                            65
      Matt and Fred charge forward on their 10-speeds through a
park. They slide to a stop, falling off their bikes, but
they're too excited to care.
65A   INT. AQUARIUM - DAY                                                65A
      They rush up to Deacon, whose biology class is near the
Beluga Whale tank.





                    MATT
          Deacon, come quick.
Deacon steps away from his class for a moment.
                    DEACON
          Matt, what's wrong?
                    BIOLOGY TEACHER (O.S.)
          Like all mammals, the whale gives birth
to live young. Can anyone name another
characteristic of mammals? Vinnie?
                    FRED
          Our site got linked by another bigger
site. Someone must have seen our stories
and liked them.
                       DEACON
          And?
                    MATT
          We got a few more pre-orders and a ton of
hits.
                       DEACON
          How many?
                       MATT
          Guess.
                    DEACON
          A thousand?
                    FRED
          Twelve thousand.
                       DEACON
          Holy shit!
Deacon high-fives the other two. They're all stoked.
                    FRED
          We need to hurry up and make this movie.
                    MATT
          We should go over the schedule for
tomorrow. And make sure the script is
ready.
Deacon's smile fades.
                    DEACON
          Uh, I can't tonight guys.
                    FRED
          Why? Where are you going?





                    DEACON
          It's this thing I have to go to.
                    MATT
          Is it a travelling carnival?
                    DEACON
          No. Look, it's this party Naomi invited
me to.
                    MATT
          Can we come?
Fred picks up on Deacon's hesitation. This isn't good.
                    DEACON
          Uh... Okay. I guess that's cool.
An awkward beat.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          I want you guys to come. It's just, I
don't know. I kind of had this vibe from
Naomi.
                    MATT
              (still doesn't get it)
We can just meet you there.
                    DEACON
          Yeah. Okay. That's cool. Look, it's at
Mark and J.T. Slistak's house. I'll see
you guys there. I've got to get back to
class.
                     MATT
          Later.
Deacon walks back to the group.
                    MATT (CONT'D)
          What are you wearing to the party?
                    FRED
          We're not really going to the party, you
moron.
                     MATT
          Why not?
                    FRED
          Because I said so.
Matt starts getting agitated.





                         MATT
               But we told Deacon-- I mean, we can't
just not show up. What if Deacon is
looking for us--
This is too complicated to explain to Matt, so Fred just
gives in.
                         FRED
               All right. All right. Stop crying
already. We'll make an appearance.
                            MATT
               Cool.
66   INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        66
     Amid this raging party, Deacon has taken his rightful place
with the in-crowd, standing dangerously close to Naomi
without his usual sidekicks weighing him down. Finally.
                         NAOMI
               You know, Rachael's coming back from
Paris in a couple of weeks.
                            DEACON
               So?
                         NAOMI
               So, aren't you even a little interested
in seeing her?
                         DEACON
               No. There's someone else I'd rather
see...
He looks into her eyes, waiting to see if the limb he's out
on is going to break. She smiles. It's working. Just then,
                            MATT
               Hey, guys.
It's his sidekicks and they've got some seriously bad timing.
Deacon shoots them an annoyed look.
                         NAOMI
               So what's this project you guys are
working on?
                         FRED
               We can't really talk about it.
                         JAKE (O.S.)
               Yeah. It's private.
Jake eyes Deacon intently.





                         JAKE (CONT'D)
               Why are you hanging around with this
loser?
                         NAOMI
               What's your problem, Jake?
                         JAKE
               What's yours?
She storms away. Deacon follows her.
67   EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT                           67
     Naomi is out on the patio.
                         DEACON
               What was that all about?
                         NAOMI
               He really pisses me off. Jake is such an
asshole.
                         DEACON
               Tell me about it.
                         NAOMI
               When we were going out, he was so mean to
me all the time. I think he's
compensating for his little dick that
never even gets hard.
Deacon chokes on his drink.
                         DEACON
               Well at least you were smart enough to
dump him. I mean, you deserve someone who
will treat you ... I don't know. Really
well.
                         NAOMI
               You know what you are?
Deacon gets a little nervous.
                         NAOMI (CONT'D)
               You're a nice guy.
She kisses him on the cheek. Deacon looks at her, then steels
himself to make a decision. He kisses her!
She's surprised, but not unwilling.
                         NAOMI (CONT'D)
               Deacon?





                         DEACON
               I've been wanting to do that for a long
time.
                         NAOMI
               So why didn't you?
Most guys would look away at this point, with a fabulous babe
with pouty lips staring you down. But Deacon passes the test:
he stands his ground and kisses her again. She likes it.
AT A WINDOW, Jake sees them kissing. He doesn't like it.
AT ANOTHER WINDOW, Fred sees it, too. And for a completely
different reason, he doesn't like it either.
68   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            68
     The set is finally ready: Ashley is lying on the bed in a
robe, the lights and camera are set, and Matt and Fred are
adjusting the video camera. The only thing missing is an
actor. Deacon ENTERS.
                         DEACON
               Hey, where's Coop?
                         FRED
               He was supposed to be here a half hour
ago.
                         MATT
               Maybe he got sucked into a black hole.
He chuckles to himself.
                         DEACON
               Good one, Spock. I can't understand why
you're not more popular with the ladies.
                         MATT
               Look, we're wasting time. Deacon, why
don't you just go in there?
Deacon balks at first, then looks over at Ashley, lying
there.
                            MATT (CONT'D)
               Come on...
                         DEACON
               Okay. Okay. All right already.
He pulls off his shirt and approaches Ashley with a pizza box
from out of nowhere.
                         MATT
               And action!





Matt starts filming while Ashley pulls Deacon near her.
                    ASHLEY (O.S.)
          Maybe I can pay for the pizza some other
way...
We hear Deacon's ZIPPER opening offscreen as Deacon rolls his
eyes and reluctantly delivers his line:
                    DEACON
          And maybe I could throw in the sausage
for free.
Deacon shows no enthusiasm for what's happening down below.
                    MATT
          Fred, you get in there, too.
                    FRED
          Are you sure?
                    MATT
          Yeah, it'll be a great shot.
Fred takes off his shorts and walks over to the other side of
the bed. Ashley is offscreen, presumably lying on the bed.
The two guys are facing each other.
                    FRED
          Hey.
                    DEACON
          S'up?
                    FRED
          How's it going?
Deacon shrugs.
                    FRED (CONT'D)
          Hey, did you see that show on Sci Fi
about sun spots?
                    DEACON
          Yeah. They said there's going to be a
massive eruption next year.
Fred starts laughing.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          What?
                    FRED
          You said "massive eruption."
Deacon starts laughing, too.





                         MATT
               Hey, quit the chatter.
                            FRED
               Sorry.
                         MATT
               Hey, why don't you guys kiss?
                            DEACON
               What?
                         MATT
               You know. Make out with each other.
                            DEACON
               What?
                            FRED
               All right.
Fred goes in to kiss Deacon, who's thoroughly confused.
Deacon holds him back with his hand.
                         DEACON
               Wait. Why do you want us to kiss?
                         MATT (O.S.)
               Because that's what guys do in gay porn.
                            DEACON
               What?
Deacon looks over at the camera. It's Ashley filming. PANIC!
He slowly looks down at the person he and Fred are having sex
with. He can barely look. It's Matt!
                         MATT
               More sausage please.
                         DEACON
               Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!
                                                           CUT TO:

     Deacon bolts up out of bed. Nightmare. Thank God.
70   INT. BASEMENT SET AS "MOVIE THEATER" - DAY                      70
     Deacon enters and the scene looks very much like the dream:
Ashley on the bed and Matt and Fred waiting around.




The set is made up to look like a movie theater, complete
with rows of seats, a bed sheet "screen," and a massive 5,000
watt light. Deacon is still a little agitated.
                    DEACON
          Where the hell is Coop? There's no way
I'm making out with Fred.
Then Coop comes out of the bathroom and sees everyone staring
at Deacon.
                    COOP
          What's going on?
                    ASHLEY
          Deacon is talking about making out with
Fred.
                    FRED
          No way. I'm holding the mike and that's
it.
                    COOP
          I thought we were doing straight porn.
                    ASHLEY
          If you guys want to do gay porn, you
still have to pay me.
                    DEACON
          Hang on. Relax. It was just this stupid
dream I had.
                    MATT
          You dreamed about making out with Fred?
                    DEACON
          No. Well, yes. And we were both having
sex with you. But it was just a dream so
let's forget it.
Everyone is a little uneasy at this admission. Deacon quickly
changes the subject.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          What's with the light?
                    MATT
          It's a "special effect." If you want this
film to look amateurish, you're going to
have to get someone else to do it.
                    DEACON
          Okay. Relax.
                    FRED
          Come on. Let's do it already.





                    MATT
          Action.
Matt starts his cheesy "projector light effect" and Coop
takes a seat next to Ashley.
                    ASHLEY
          This summer tent-pole event-movie is
making me so scared.
                    COOP
          Hide your head down here and I'll tell
you when it's safe to come up.
As she starts to go down, we turn our attention...
ON FRED and DEACON, away from the action.
                    FRED
              (snide; whispers)
How's Naomi?
                    DEACON
          Fine.
                    COOP (O.S.)
          Not yet. This is the really scary part.
                    DEACON
              (whispers)
Hey. Can I ask you a question?
Fred shrugs. The memory of the nightmare is wreaking havoc
with Deacon's conscience.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          Do you ever think maybe we've gotten
ourselves in a little over our heads with
all of this?
                    COOP (O.S.)
          Oh, baby. Not yet.
Fred appears to be pondering the question deeply. His face
slowly contorts to a look of seeming anguish. Then,
                    FRED
          Fire!
The coiled cord to the massive light is burning a circular
hole in the smouldering carpet.
                    COOP
          Unplug the light!
Deacon moves to unplug it.





                          MATT
                Wait, it's hot!
Too late. Deacon touches the cord, SCREAMS, and reels back,
knocking the light over.
It EXPLODES onto the floor. The carpet bursts into FLAMES.
                          FRED
                Run!
Ashley and Coop run up the stairs. Fred isn't far behind.
                          MATT
                Quick, get the fire extinguisher!
                          DEACON
                Where is it?
                          MATT
                Over there!
He spots it in the corner and grabs it. Meanwhile the flames
are growing.
Deacon comes over and aims the extinguisher at the flames. He
depresses the lever. Nothing.
                          DEACON
                It's not working!
Matt thinks about it for a second.
                          MATT
                Oh. Me and Fred used it when we wrote the
foamy cat fight script last week.
71    INT. FRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         71
      Matt and Fred are giggling and prancing around the room in
bikinis discharging the fire extinguishers at each other.
72    INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                             72
      Deacon looks at him strangely for a beat, then runs into the
72A   INT. BASEMENT - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)                    72A
      He looks around frantically. Nothing. Then, he starts the
WASHING MACHINE. It slowly starts to fill up.
                          MATT (O.S.)
                Hurry!
Deacon turns the dial to "large load," pauses and chuckles to
himself.





                          DEACON
                Large load.
                          MATT (O.S.)
                Deacon! Hurry!
Deacon snaps out of it and grabs the laundry detergent
bottle. He scoops up some water and RUNS into the other room.
72B   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY (CONTINUOUS)                               72B
      He throws the soapy water onto the fire and Matt. The fire
goes out, but Matt's not too happy about getting soaked.
73    INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)                    73
      Coop is looking down the stairs to the basement. Fred is
freaking out. Ashley is still topless but covering herself
up, having just put on her panties. She goes to put on her
shirt when
                          MRS. LEWIS (O.S.)
                What's going on here?
      DEACON'S PARENTS
      are standing in the doorway to the kitchen with Max, whose
arm is in a splint. Max stares at Ashley. She covers herself
some more.
Then, Deacon and Matt enter the kitchen from downstairs.
                             MAX
                Nice rack.
                          DEACON
                Mom! Dad! What are you doing home?
                          MRS. LEWIS
                Max sprained his wrist at soccer
practice. What is going on here?
                          MR. LEWIS
                Well, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation why there's a naked girl in
our kitchen. Right, Deacon?
Deacon isn't too sure.
                             MRS. LEWIS
                Well...
                             DEACON
                I, uh...
Deacon's mind is racing. Then,





                    ASHLEY
          I'm Deacon's girlfriend. Ashley.
          MRS. LEWIS                       MR. LEWIS            *


                    DEACON
          Yes, my girlfriend.
                    MRS. LEWIS
          And what were you doing with your clothes
off in my kitchen?
                    ASHLEY
          We were having a make out party.
                    MRS. LEWIS
          Where are the other girls?
                    DEACON
          Their dates stood them up?
                    COOP
          Yeah. My date wasn't feeling well.
                    FRED
          Mine has mono. From too much making out.
With me.
                    MRS. LEWIS
          What's that smell?
                    MATT
          We had a small fire, Mrs. Lewis. I tipped
over a candle. It was to set the right
mood.
                    MR. LEWIS
          A fire? Let me see the damage.
                    DEACON
          Dad, don't. Let me take responsibility.
We'll pay to have it fixed.
Deacon's Dad looks at Ashley again. He can't hide his pride.
                    MR. LEWIS
          Damn right you will.
                    MRS. LEWIS
          Well, Ashley. I didn't know Deacon even
had a girlfriend.
                    MR. LEWIS
          Maybe you can join us for dinner tonight.
Ashley looks at Deacon. Deacon's Mom glares at Dad.





                           DEACON
                 I think Ashley's busy tonight--
                            ASHLEY
                 Okay.
Oh, shit.
                           MRS. LEWIS
                 Okay, then.
74   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                           74
     Ashley is eating dinner with the Lewises. Max keeps staring
at her. Mr. Lewis steals a few glances of Ashley himself
while continuing his work-related rant.
                           MR. LEWIS
                 So get this. Johnson comes up to me today
and he's all like "where's the ND-90's?"
I'm like, "Johnson, they discontinued the
ND-90 like six weeks ago." I've been
telling this guy...
                           ASHLEY
                 Johnson sounds like a moron.
                            MR. LEWIS
                 Exactly!
Mr. Lewis is psyched that someone is finally paying attention
to him. Mrs. Lewis doesn't like the way he's looking at her.
                           MRS. LEWIS
                 So, Ashley. If I could ask you a personal
question, exactly how old are you?
                           ASHLEY
                 Nineteen. But I tell people eighteen.
Deacon laughs nervously.
                           DEACON
                 Isn't that funny?
The doorbell rings.
                           DEACON (CONT'D)
                 I'll get it.
     FOYER
     Deacon open the door. It's Naomi.
                           DEACON
                 What are you doing here?





                    NAOMI
          I thought I'd come by and surprise you.
Maybe we could hang out in your bedroom.
She looks at him seductively. Deacon looks over his shoulder.
                    DEACON
          Now's not a good time.
                    NAOMI
          What's wrong?
                    DEACON
          Nothing. Let's talk later.
He tries to close the door, but she stops it.
                    MRS. LEWIS (O.S.)
          Deacon, who is it?
Too late. Naomi comes in.
                    NAOMI
          Hi, Mrs. Lewis. I'm Naomi. I'm Deacon's
girlfriend.
And with that she looks at Deacon, figuring she just made his
day. It fails, however, to achieve the desired effect.
                    MRS. LEWIS
          His girlfriend?
She looks at Deacon. Max pokes his head through.
                    MAX
          Deacon has two girlfriends?
                    DEACON
          Shut up, Max!
                    NAOMI
          What do you mean? What's going on?
                    MAX
          Deacon's other girlfriend is having
dinner with us.
                    DEACON
          I can explain.
Naomi walks into the kitchen with Max.
                    MAX
          This is Deacon's other girlfriend,
Ashley.





                         MR. LEWIS
               His other girlfriend?
Dad's beaming with pride. The two girls size each other up.
                           ASHLEY
               Hi.
                         NAOMI
               Oh, my God. How old are you, you slut?
                           ASHLEY
               Eighteen.
                         NAOMI
               I thought you were a nice guy.
Naomi storms out of the house. Deacon follows, then Ashley.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               You need to have a talk with him. He
could be having S-E-X.
                         MR. LEWIS
               I need to give him a goddamn medal.
(she storms off)
What?
     FOYER
     Deacon watches Naomi go. Ashley consoles him.
                         ASHLEY
               Let her go.
                         DEACON
               Are you insane? I've been fantasizing
about Naomi Feldman since the seventh
grade.
                         ASHLEY
               Fantasy and reality are two different
things, Deacon. Don't fall in love with
who you think she is. You have to be sure
you love the real person.
                         DEACON
               So what should I do?
                         ASHLEY
               Go after her then. Or don't. Whatever.
He looks at Ashley for a beat, then goes after Naomi.
75   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                             75
     Naomi and Deacon are arguing under a street light.





                         NAOMI
               She's a porno actress in your porno film.
She had to pretend to be your girlfriend
because she ran upstairs naked when the
light caused a fire. And you've never had
sex with her or even kissed her.
                         DEACON
               Yeah, pretty much.
He looks down.
                         DEACON (CONT'D)
               So, I guess this means you're not my
girlfriend anymore.
                         NAOMI
               Not necessarily.
She looks at him with newfound interest.
                         NAOMI (CONT'D)
               I want to come to the set tomorrow.
                         DEACON
               No, I don't think that's a good idea.
                         NAOMI
               Why not? I'm curious. I've never seen a
porno movie actually being made.
                         DEACON
               Matt and Fred will get really mad. We're
not supposed to tell anyone.
                         NAOMI
               Tell them I'm a ... creative consultant.
For the female point of view.
                         DEACON
               No offense, but the female point of view
doesn't really matter in these films.
She looks at him, pouting.
                         DEACON (CONT'D)
               Okay. Okay.
76   CLOSE ON a computer monitor displaying the A.S.S. Website.         76
The cursor is clicking through the various pages: text
stories, pictures of the set, still photos of Ashley and
Coop, etc. But more importantly, the "hits" counter looks
like the odometer on a rocket ship.
PULL BACK to reveal...





76A   INT. VIC'S "STUDIO" - DAY                                          76A
      Mike is surfing the web while eating a large bratwurst
sandwich. Vic enters in his signature robe.
                          MIKE
                This After School Special shit is
amazing. They're getting a ton of hits
off their stupid stories and they don't
even have any product.
                          VIC
                Are you sure those are the guys from the
Pretty Kitty?
                          MIKE
                It's the same guys. Bingo. I just found
out where they live.
                          VIC
                Give me that address. I'm gonna teach
these assholes a little lesson about the
adult film business.
He takes the piece of paper and storms out the door.
                          MIKE
                Vic!
He pops back in.
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
                You going like that?
Vic looks down at his robe.
                          VIC
                Oh, yeah. Thanks Mike.
Vic puts his slippers on. They do the jive hand shake and hug
thing again.
77    INT. VIC'S CAR, PARKED - DAY                                        77
      Vic checks the address of the house against the print out.
                          VIC
                Goddamn amateurs. Think they can screw
with Vic Ramalot.
                          MIKE
                Let's do this.
78    EXT. STREET - DAY                                                   78
      They get out of the car and Mike places the gun in his pants.
They walk up to the front door and bang. It opens, revealing





MR. GREITZER.

          You Greitzer?
                    GREITZER
          Yes. That's me.
Vic's a little confused. He looks at the piece of paper.
                    VIC
          Ronald J. Greitzer?
                    GREITZER
          Yes. That's right.
Then, a spark of understanding.
                    VIC
          Oh, I get it. Brilliant. You're not even
a fuckin' kid.
Mike pulls the gun out and puts it to Greitzer's head.
Greitzer drops his glass of soda, raises his hands, and
starts shaking, terrified.
                    GREITZER
          What are you doing?
                    VIC
          What am I doing? I'm retiring you from
the porno business. Permanently.
Understand?
                    GREITZER
          Yes. Yes. Please don't hurt me.
                    VIC
          No more sweet young pussy, no more hot
school-girl fantasies, no more goddamn
pornos "for virgins by virgins." You got
me?
Greitzer's eyes dart over to the side, and for the first
time, Vic steps into the house and sees: LITTLE GIRLS.
It's Greitzer's little daughter's birthday party. Six-year-
old GIRLS and their stunned PARENTS all stare at Vic.
Greitzer's wife comes over, screaming and crying.
                    GREITZER'S WIFE
          Please don't hurt my husband!
                    VIC
          Uh...





                         GREITZER
               I'm sorry! I'll never rent them again! It
was only that one time my wife was at her
sister's! Please! I promise you!
                         GREITZER'S WIFE
               You rented a dirty movie? You told me it
was Jakob the Liar!
Mike lowers the gun and they start backing out of there.
                         GREITZER
               What? I shouldn't be entitled to a little
joy in life?
                         GREITZER'S WIFE
               Now look at the trouble you've brought to
this house.
                         GREITZER
               And I'm supposed to know the Religious
Right would come after me for renting an
adult film?
As they continue to fight, Vic and Mike run back to the car.
79   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                                79
     Dress rehearsals. Naomi is sitting at the kitchen table
talking to Ashley, who's wearing a sexy cheerleader outfit.
Deacon is at the microwave making popcorn.
                         NAOMI
               Five hundred dollars a night?
                         ASHLEY
               Yeah, but if you can break into films,
like these ones, you can get featured
dancing gigs and make ten times that
much.
                         NAOMI
               No way.
                         ASHLEY
               Seriously. If these guys ever get their
act together.
Matt stumbles in carrying a pile of scripts. Fred walks in
behind him and sees Naomi.
                         FRED
               What is she doing here?
                         DEACON
               Naomi is my girlfriend.





Fred exchanges a glance with Matt.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          And I wanted her to help out. Give the
script a female point of view.
Fred pulls Deacon aside.
                    FRED
          Jesus, Deacon. Didn't you see that
Beatles documentary on the History
Channel? You're pulling a Yoko Ono on us.
                    DEACON
          What?
                    FRED
          Fine. Whatever. Let's get started. I'm
sure she'll be really helpful.
Coop comes out of the bathroom dressed as the Math Team
Captain, complete with nerd glasses, pocket protector, etc.
                    COOP
          Oh, hey, Naomi.
                    NAOMI
          Hey, Coop. Are you helping these guys,
too?
                    COOP
              (sheepishly)
Sort of.
                    MATT
          Okay, people. Places everybody. Let's try
to do this with a little heart, okay? And
action.
Everyone turns to their scripts and starts the rehearsal.
                    ASHLEY
          This quadratic equation is so hard.
                    COOP
          Well, maybe we should just stick to long
division.
Coop drops his corduroys and Naomi gasps. She stares at
Coop's "slide rule" for a beat, then snaps out of it.
                    NAOMI
          Wait a second. Cut. This is all wrong.
She wouldn't be fantasizing about some
geek.





                    MATT
          He's not a geek. He's the Math Team
Captain.
                    NAOMI
          No, he should be really well-dressed, and
maybe he's a foreign exchange student
from Portugal.
                    MATT
          Um, and the director is the only one
who's allowed to say "cut."
                    FRED
          Who cares, Naomi?
                    NAOMI
          Deacon agrees with me, don't you?
Matt and Fred look at Deacon.
                    COOP
          Dudes, come on. My nuts are getting cold.
                    ASHLEY
          I'm out of here.
                    NAOMI
          Shut up, Coop. This is important.
                    COOP
              (swings his arms out)
And my nuts aren't?
Coop's hand accidentally smacks Ashley in the nose as she's
getting up. She SCREAMS.
                    DEACON
          Are you okay?
                    COOP
          I'm sorry, Ashley.
She's pissed, holding her nose.
                    ASHLEY
          Look. This is ridiculous. Who does dress
rehearsals for a porno shoot?
                    MATT
          Oh, sure. Why don't we throw out the
script while we're at it and "improvise."





                         ASHLEY
               Guys, I appreciate the money. It's nice
to get paid for sitting around doing
nothing, but this isn't helping my
career. I've got no footage for my reel.
She packs up.
                         FRED
               Where are you going?
                         ASHLEY
               Sorry.
She leaves.
                         COOP
               Ashley, wait. I'm sorry. Ashley!
Then, he blurts out something unexpected:
                         COOP (CONT'D)
                   (calling after her)
I love you!
Coop exchanges an awkward glance with the guys: he's said too
much. He goes after Ashley, with his pants still around his
ankles and his bare ass in full display.
He stumbles on his pants and falls on his face. He gets up
quickly and continues after her, still with his pants down.
                         FRED
               Now what are we going to do? Your
"girlfriend" ruined everything.
                         DEACON
               Coop's the one that smacked her.
                         NAOMI
               Besides, if you losers knew anything
about women, we wouldn't have this
problem.
                         FRED
               Who asked you?
                         NAOMI
               I don't have to take this.
She storms off, leaving Deacon there to make a decision. He
looks at Matt and Fred for a beat, then follows Naomi. Fred
and Matt are crushed.
80   EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - DAY                                80
     Ashley is walking through the parking lot on the way to work.





                         MRS. LEWIS (O.S.)
               Ashley?
It's Deacon's Mom, in the adjacent lot. She walks over to
her.
                         ASHLEY
               Mrs. Lewis!
                         MRS. LEWIS
               What are you doing here?
                         ASHLEY
               I, um, I'm... I'm going where you're
going.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               To yoga class?
                         ASHLEY
               Yes. Exactly.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               I haven't seen you in class before.
                         ASHLEY
               It's my first time.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Well, that's great, Ashley. You're really
going to love it.
She escorts her towards the yoga class building.
                         MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
               It's really easy, but if you can't keep
up, just follow my lead.
                                                           CUT TO:

     The entire class of slackjawed MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN yoga
students stare in disbelief. Even the instructor is amazed.
     ASHLEY
     is essentially folded in half, her legs pinned well beyond
her ears. She's obviously been in this position before.
82   INT. YOGA CLASS - LATER                                            82
     The women are gathering their things after class, some still
eyeing Ashley jealously.





                         MRS. LEWIS
               You're quite flexible, Ashley.
                         ASHLEY
               Yeah, people tell me that all the time.
You know, I could teach you some of those
moves. Mr. Lewis would love it.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Oh. Okay. Maybe later. Listen, Ashley. I
want to ask you something... personal.
About you and Deacon.
                            ASHLEY
               Uh huh.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               You know Deacon is only seventeen.
                            ASHLEY
               Uh huh.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Right. So I was just wondering. You know.
If you and Deacon... Well, if Deacon and
you were...
                            ASHLEY
               Um, no.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Good. Good. That's very good.
She gives Ashley a warm little hug.
                         ASHLEY
               Listen, Mrs. Lewis. You don't have to
worry about Deacon. He's a good kid. If
you just let him make his own mistakes in
life, he's going to turn out fine.
83   INT. NAOMI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                83
     Deacon and Naomi are under the covers, making out.
                         NAOMI
               So, do you have anything?
                            DEACON
               Like what?
                         NAOMI
               You know. Protection.
                         DEACON
               Oh. Oh yeah. Of course.





She sees he's nervous.
                    NAOMI
          Don't you want to?
                    DEACON
          Of course I do.
                    NAOMI
          Then what's the problem?
Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the
taking. A long beat. Then,
                    DEACON
          It's my first time.
                    NAOMI
          That's okay. Just go slow.
And he does. He's nervous at first, not sure what to do. But
as she kisses him softly, suddenly we start to hear the slow
fade in of PORNO MUSIC playing in Deacon's head. (Now that
Deacon's actually having sex, it's involunarily triggering
the only thing he knows about sex: porno movies.) The music
grows louder when:
                    FRED (V.O.)
              (in Deacon's head)
Every two minutes, they change positions.
He pauses, and cocks his head in confusion. He tries to shake
Fred's voice out of his head, but he can't.
                    FRED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It's a basic rule of porno.
Finally, he gives in to the porno music. He rolls Naomi on
top of him.
                                                  JUMP CUT TO:

                    FRED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The door. Always a classic.
                                                  JUMP CUT TO:

up on it. Naomi likes it.
                    ASHLEY (V.O.)
          Fantasy and reality are two different
things.
                                                  JUMP CUT TO:





Naomi's HAND presses up against the window. It slowly falls
to the ground.
                          FRED (V.O.)
                It's a basic rule of porno.
                                                          JUMP CUT TO:
      Back on the bed, Naomi is in a state of complete bliss,
having had her first ever orgasm.
                          ASHLEY (V.O.)
                Fantasy and reality are two different
things...
But Deacon doesn't share Naomi's contentment. He looks
troubled.
83A   INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                     83A
      The next night, Deacon is talking to Ashley backstage as
she's getting ready to go on.
                          DEACON
                I don't know. It was weird. Is it
supposed to be so weird?
                          ASHLEY
                Of course it was weird. True love can
only exist between two women.
Deacon is stunned.
                          ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                Just kidding. I don't know, Deacon. Do
you like this girl?
He hesitates a bit too long.
                          DEACON
                Of course I do.
                          ASHLEY
                Your heart is telling you that you don't.
And I think it's time you start listening
to your heart.
Deacon still doesn't get it.
                          ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                Look. I have to go on. Just do whatever
you want. Or don't. Whatever.





84   INT. DAVE'S DUPES - DAY                                            84
     Vic and Mike wait at the counter for his video copies of
volume 28. DAVE (cameo for the director, DME) comes to the
counter with a box.
                         VIC
               Thanks, Dave.
                         DAVE
               Vic.
He turns to leave just as another GUY (cameo for the writer,
DHS) comes up to Dave with a pad of paper.
                         VIDEO DUPE GUY
               Hey, Dave, there's a guy on the phone who
wants to set up a new account.
                         DAVE
               What's it for?
                         VIDEO DUPE GUY
               Some outfit called After School Special.
They turn back.
                         MIKE
               What did you just say?
                         VIDEO DUPE GUY
               Nothing. It's for another customer.
Mike grabs him by the collar and pulls him over to Vic.
                         VIC
               Did you say "After School Special"?
Mike grabs the paper, drops the guy, and he and Vic rush out
of the store. After they're gone:
                         VIDEO DUPE GUY
               Shit, man. You must be crazy.
(calling after them)
Better watch your back, homie! You might
get smoked!
85   INT. PEACHTREE & FINCH - DAY                                       85
     Naomi is dragging Deacon into the store featuring posters of
buff male models with nut-hugging boxer briefs.
                         DEACON
               What are we doing here?





                         NAOMI
               What? I thought you might want some new
clothes.
                         DEACON
               I don't need any new clothes.
                         NAOMI
               And guess what? I booked facials for us
at the Serenity Spa.
                         DEACON
               Naomi. Wait. Stop.
He stops her.
                         NAOMI
               What's wrong?
                          DEACON
               I have to meet up with Matt and Fred this
afternoon. I already blew them off
yesterday.
                         NAOMI
               Deacon, you don't have to hang out with
those guys any more. Besides, you really
need a facial. And I mean, I thought we
could spend the day together. You know,
after last night.
                         DEACON
               But what about Matt and Fred?
                         NAOMI
               Well what about me?
She pouts. She has him under her thumb. He takes her hand and
continues into the store.
86   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                         86
     Deacon walks in really late, but wearing a hot new Peachtree
& Finch outfit. And his skin seems to glow. Matt and Fred
glare at him from the far end of the couch.
                         DEACON
               What's going on? Are we going to find
another girl?
(off their look)
What?
                         FRED
               Matt and I have been talking.
                         DEACON
               Yeah. About what?





                          MATT
                We want to make this movie.
                          DEACON
                I know. I do, too.
                          FRED
                No, Deacon. We want to make the movie we
wrote. We want to make it without you.
                          DEACON
                Okay. I know what this is about, guys.
I'm sorry about Naomi.
                          FRED
                That's not the problem, Deacon.
                          DEACON
                Then what is it?
                          FRED
                I thought this was about us having fun
and doing something crazy together. But
as soon as you got what you wanted, you
blew us off.
                          DEACON
                You don't understand.
Fred cuts to the chase.
                          FRED
                Do you even like her?
Deacon is about to tell them. Then,
                          DEACON
                Fine. Go ahead without me.
                          FRED
                Fine.
Matt and Fred get up and leave.

87    INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                               87
      The family eats dinner in silence. Deacon feels like shit.
                            MRS. LEWIS
                  So, Deacon. How'd you think you did on
your midterms?
                              DEACON
                  Fine.
                            MAX
                  I found a dead bird on the soccer field.
Its head was missing.
Deacon's Dad pushes away his plate and gets up.
                            MR. LEWIS
                  I have to go back to the office tonight.
Johnson screwed the pooch again.
                              MRS. LEWIS
                  Whatever.
88    INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT                                88
      Deacon's Dad gets into the Aerostar. He turns on the radio,
which blasts a ROCKING SONG. He quickly changes it back to an
      EASY LISTENING TUNE.

      He pulls in to the lot and parks. He steps out of the car and
starts to walk to his office. Only it's not his office.
It's...
89    EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)                     89
      He passes the Bouncer, still reading Aristotle's Ethics.
                              BOUNCER
                  Enjoy.
90    INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                      90
      Ashley is changing into her school girl outfit.
                            PLANTAIN
                  Ash, you ready? You're up now.
90A   INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT                                 90A
      DEACON'S DAD enters the club and pays the cashier.
      INTERCUT:





90B   ASHLEY sprays glitter on her body backstage.                      90B
90C   DEACON'S DAD takes a seat right up front.                         90C
                          D.J. (O.S.)
                ... they work hard for their money, guys,
so let's tip them good. All right. Now,
on the main carousel, let's give it up
for the naughty school girl. ASHLEY!
Applause. Ashley struts out through the cloud of stage FOG,
right up to Deacon's Dad...
... who's turned around, ordering a drink. He turns back to
see...
... Ashley's back, as she swings around the pole. She struts
by each of the men in the front row, reaching down to take
dollar bills out of their hands. She walks over to Deacon's
Dad...
... but he's tipping the waitress. She does another spin
around the pole...
and lands in a split, face to face with...
... Deacon's Dad, who happens to have a crisp dollar bill
between his teeth.
They immediately recognize each other and FREEZE. A long
beat. Then:
                          MR. LEWIS
                Hello, naughty school girl whom I've
never met before.
                          ASHLEY
                You, too, are someone whose kitchen I've
never been in.
Another beat, then she grabs the bill out of his teeth, and
quickly moves away.
91    INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT                     91
      Dad walks upstairs, still a little stunned.
                          MRS. LEWIS
                You get everything done at work?
                          MR. LEWIS
                Yeah. All set.
                          MRS. LEWIS
                Oh, guess who I ran into? Deacon's
girlfriend, Ashley.





Dad freezes.
                         MR. LEWIS
               Where did you see Ashley?
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Over on Industrial Way.
                         MR. LEWIS
               You were on Industrial?
                         MRS. LEWIS
               You know, she is so flexibl
