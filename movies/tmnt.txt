Studio logo transitions into a CONSTELLATION in space. Cam
pulls BACK, as more stars enter frame, forming a starfield.

                         A sensei once counseled a grief-
stricken boy, as his older brother

          3
                         prepared to leave for battle.
N STARS - Begin to see a DOZEN or so stars, almost forming a
zig-zagged line. Cam continues to adjust.

                         He said, "Child, why do you cry?
You are both part of a family. And
a family is a bond that cannot be
broken by war. By strife. By force
or neglect.
N STARS - Cam slows its truck-out to a gradual stop as we
see the pattern beginning to form. As if following the stars'
pattern, the CAM LOWERS as we find ourselves going into-

              O
              LOWER - framing the tops of JUNGLE, moonlit and surrounded by
mist. A mountain range peaks over the horizon.

              SUPER TITLE: SOME STINKING JUNGLE IN SOUTH AMERICA
              CAM RESTS atop an old CHURCH ROOF. The peaceful scene is
suddenly stopped by a MACHINE GUN BURST! CAM CRANES over the

              roof revealing -





                                                                            3

              EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

A relatively modern village... for a remote jungle. Dawn is
JUST barely beginning to break. The morning mist persists as
we see FOUR FEDERALES with machine guns surrounding a group
of VILLAGERS.

              O
               N GROUND - A WOMAN VILLAGER is thrown down. Her SON, 8, runs

          1
              to her side. She's mad. Her son cries.



                                                                          2.







                                  WOMAN VILLAGER
                        You monsters!
UP ANGLE - As we see the THREE FEDERALES, greasy men, holding
AK-47's, and looking down with hardened indifference. OS, we
hear an EVIL CHUCKLE. The men part as we see-
- COL. PANTERA. A bottom-heavy disgusting pig of a man walks
up between them. Pantera leans down, face to face with her.

                                  PANTERA
                        We appreciate the generous donation
for the continued protection of
your village.
ANGLE ON - Their jeep, overflowing with the Village's
precious crops.
WIDER - A tiny group (10) of other villagers stand at a safe
distance. The Woman's HUSBAND runs forward. He immediately
LUNGES at Pantera, just as-
-SHIKA-SHIKA - Pantera is flanked by 3 MACHINE GUNS pointed
at the Husband's chest. Pantera slothfully grins. He leans
forward and yanks an HEIRLOOM NECKLACE from her neck.

                                  PANTERA
                        After all, the jungle can be a very
dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA.
They jump into the Jeep and tear into the jungle LAUGHING.





              EXT. JUNGLE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER


          4                                                                    4
              The jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path. Pantera sits
in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in around the
food. The Jungle looms ominous around them.

              H
               IGH ANGLE - As we watch the jeep from the jungle ceiling
high above... as if from someone's POV.
ON DRIVER - He suddenly reacts to a fallen tree on the road
ahead. Slams on the brakes. Pantera is thrown around.

                                  PANTERA
                        Idiota! Watch where you're going!

                                  DRIVER SOLIDER
                        There's a log on the road, senor.
(quietly to himself)
...that wasn't there an hour ago.

                                   PANTERA
                        Well, what are you waiting for?!

                        REMOVE IT!
                            (to soldiers behind)
Cortez! Andelay!

          CORTEZ leaps out. Grabs the winch from the front of the jeep
and pulls it to the log, roughly 15 feet away.
EEP POV - Pantera and Driver barely notice the out-of-focus
bg Cortez get suddenly YANKED out of scene!

                               CORTEZ (O.S.)
                    ...yirk!
ON DRIVER - His eyes go wide. Trying to see in the dark.

                              DRIVER SOLIDER
                        (softly, nervous)
D-d-dios mio.
ON LOG - Cortez is gone. Pantera wakes up.

                              PANTERA
                    What?! WHAT IS IT?!
OS - Hear the sound of a CHAIN clinking. Then WHOOSHING as
the chain winch suddenly FLIES IN, and CRACKS the BURLY
SOLDIER across the jaw! It wraps itself around his neck.
Before he can react...
- YOINK! He gets pulled over the hood of the jeep, landing on
the ground HARD.

                                URLY SOLDIER

                    OOF!
          Burly gets pulled backward... away from the Jeep and into...
the darkness. He SCREAMS the entire way, clawing the ground.
ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now. Last Soldier is in the
back. Pantera stands up in the jeep. "Last" jumps out and
readies his machine gun.

                              PANTERA
                        (to Jungle)

                    WHO ARE YOU?! SHOW YOURSELF!!

                              DRIVER SOLIDER

                        (WHISPER)
                    ...The Ghost of the Jungle.

                               PANTERA
                    What?!

                              DRIVER SOLDIER

                           (
                         shaking/nervous)
The jungle god that punishes those
who prey upon the weak.
(looks scared to Pantera)
He's coming... for us.

              OS NOISE - Suddenly hear the whooshing of 4 quick punches,
kicks, a short machine gun burst and a WHUMP. Pantera and
Driver look to the ground.
ON GROUND - Last Soldier lays beaten on the jungle floor.

                                  DRIVER SOLIDER
                        I'm sorry, senor.
Driver bounds out of the Jeep and runs SCREAMING into the
jungle. CAM PULLS BACK with him as Pantera shrinks in bg.

                                  PANTERA

                        COWARD!! GET BACK HERE!!
              Something suddenly skitters behind Pantera! He turns to look.
Nothing. He reaches down and pulls up... a MACHETE.

                                  PANTERA

                        SHOW YOURSELF! DO YOU REALIZE WHO

                        YOU'RE DEALING WITH?!
              ON PANTERA - He circles backs against the Jungle wall, trying
to find him. Tense. Suddenly-
-a PAIR OF WHITE EYES open in the blackness behind him!
n a quick series of shots we see Pantera getting the raw end
of a flurry of fist and foot attacks. His attacker is moving
way too fast for the camera to keep up.
Pantera falls back, panting heavily. Panicked. He tears off
into the dense Jungle!
ON PANTERA RUNNING THROUGH JUNGLE - Thick foliage. Panicked.





              EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS


          5                                                                    5
              An oasis of calm, violated by this sweating, machete-
clutching brute. He stumbles, then stands in the middle.

                                    ANTERA
                        I am not afraid of a myth!
(eyes darting)

                                  A

                        I'M NOT AFRAID OF A GHOST!

                                   TTACKER (O.S.)
                        Actually... it's "Turtle", pal.
Pantera swings around. Eyes wide.
N ATTACKER - We pan up the thick green legs. Muscular and
strong. Further up. Arms to match. Rough skin. It wears a
shorn HOODED PONCHO. Inside are two white eyes and gritted
smiling teeth.
The poncho falls to the ground.



                                                                       5.






              ON ATTACKER - It's LEONARDO! Beaten blue bandana blowing in
the breeze. Total hero shot. He pulls out a SINGLE KATANA
SWORD, poised for battle. Pantera's backed into a corner.

                                  PANTERA
                        Let's see if a ghost can die, then.
Pantera SCREAMS and runs to Leo and starts swinging! At the
CLASH of sword and machete, we-

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

              EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The Boy is still at the Village Clearing. Suddenly -
- the sound of the JEEP begins to rumble in the distance! The
villagers panic and scatter. VROOM! The Jeep flies out of the
jungle and bounce-slows into the FG!
Only there is no one driving it... and it still has the
stolen food in it. And the stolen medallion dangles from the
rear view mirror.

                                  WOMAN VILLAGER
                        It's a miracle!
The village rejoices. The Boy steps aside for a beat, looks
back at the Jungle. Something catches his eye.
...a small crouched figure on a tree branch. Barely
silhouetted. His white eyes lit in the darkness. One of them
WINKS as the boy smiles.

                                   B

                                   OY VILLAGER

              Leo leaps into frame. He takes out his katanas and lays them
carefully on the ground. He KNEELS, head bowed, eyes closed.

                                  LEONARDO
                        My training is now complete.
The camera lifts away from Leo... and then PLUNGES into the
nearby CAVERN. MUSIC begins to swell. Cam travels a few feet
until it DIPS TO BLACK, and comes up beginning our-

              INT. MISCELLANEOUS SEWER, OIL AND IRRIGATION PIPES

The music is in full tilt as the camera travels through
seemingly miles of underground pipes of all types and design.
he camera comes to the end of line. It rises up through
9   STEAM... then through a metal grate, as we find ourselves in-





              EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT                             9

A mouse-level shot of the spectacular city that never sleeps.
It's oddly hypnotic. Still. Until...
- BAM! A pair of sneakers land barely in front of the camera,
tearing off into the distance.

                                  NYPD #1 (O.S.)

                        FREEEZE! STOP OR WE'LL SHOOT!
              Shoes belong to a panicked MUGGER, early 20's, as THREE NYPD
OFFICERS clamor after him. The Mugger is a jackrabbit -
hopping newspaper machines, rolling under passing trucks and
doing anything he can to avoid arrest.
ventually the NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles.

                                  MUGGER
                        Heh, heh... suckers.
ON MUGGER - His eyes suddenly go wide as - VROOOOOM! - we see
a jet-black tweaked out motorcycle fly over the cops' heads,
aiming directly for Mugger!

                                   MUGGER
                        Whaaa!!!
The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in
all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet. Scary
and faceless. He quickly gains on the Mugger and GRABS him by
the collar in mid-stride!

                                  MUGGER
                        You crazy?! Put me down, man!
But Driver doesn't. Instead, he holds him lower without
stopping the bike... and proceeds to plow Mugger's head into
every trash can and garbage bin along 9th Avenue!

                                  MUGGER

                        OW! HEY! WHAT'RE YOU-OW!! OOF!
              Just as it looks like he'll hit a telephone pole... Driver
veers left! He drags the Mugger into...

               A









                                                                           7.

               EXT. DEAD END ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS

Driver tosses him onto the ground at full speed. Mugger
SLIDES down the alley and collides with a pile of garbage
like he's a human bowling ball.
ON HEAD OF ALLEY - The Driver guns the bike and kicks up a
ton of dust and racket, peeling donuts at mouth of the alley.
And then he stops. Dust slowly settles and smoke dissipates.

                                   MUGGER
                         Wh-wh-what kinda freak are you?!
The Driver gets off the bike. Silence. Backlit by headlight.
He walks directly to the Mugger with purpose. Mugger starts
to really freak out. Driver picks him up by the collar and
SLAMS him to the back WOODEN FENCE WALL.

                                   MUGGER
                         P-p-please. Don't kill me, man.
Driver just cocks his head. Mugger can see his own terrified
reflection his Driver's black visor. Driver reaches behind
his back and pulls out a COMBAT KNIFE! He reels back and...

                                   MUGGER
                         Wh-wha-wha-WHAT ARE YOU DOI- AAAGH!

               W
                HAM! - Driver nails the dagger through the Mugger's JACKET,
PINNING HIM TO THE WALL. Driver turns around to gather the
purse's belongings at the mouth of the alley.
fter he stops cringing, the Mugger wriggles the blade out of
the wall. Driver doesn't notice as - THWIP-IP-IP! - he hurls
the knife at the Driver!
THUNK! It sticks in the DRIVER'S BACK!
N MUGGER - His grinning eyes suddenly GO WIDE as Driver
slowly turns around, UNHURT! The Mugger is trapped as Driver
moves toward him... and a BOLO CHAIN drops to his side.
ON WALL SHADOW - as we see a flurry of punches, kicks and
throws as Driver lays a beating on the criminal who needs to
be taught a lesson. An OS Police Siren chirps.
MOUTH OF ALLEY - The police suddenly show up, cherries
flashing. They run to FG, mouths drop.

                                    NYPD #1
                         ...whoa.

                                   NYPD #2
                         The Nightwatcher.

               ON MUGGER - Hung upside down by a chain. Purse hangs from his
neck. He'll live, but never commit another crime again...

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON A NEWSSTAND - Headlines read "WOMAN MYSTERIOUSLY

               RESCUED FROM BURNING BUILDING". "POLICE SEEK MAN KNOWN AS

               `THE NIGHTWATCHER' FOR QUESTIONING". "WHO IS THE

               NIGHTWATCHER?"
               WIDER - A quieter area of the city. Broken by the squealing
of the bike as Driver (Nightwatcher) roars in to a stop.
Nightwatcher drives underneath a TRAIN BRIDGE. He takes off
his helmet. Red cloth spills out. He turns around as we see-

               - RAPHAEL, THE RED-MASKED NINJA TURTLE!
               He reaches back and pulls out the KNIFE from his SHELL. Looks

QUICK SHOTS - Ignites and revs engine. Straps helmet back on.
Headlight comes to life. Lets the clutch out.
VROOOOM! - CAM STARTS TIGHT ON bike as Raphael tears away.

                                   MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                         Dude... I'm scared!

                                                                 CUT TO:
               CLOSE ON - A PAIR OF TURTLE EYES... MICHAELANGELO'S! They're
wide with FEAR. Nervously darting around, unable to keep up
with the surrounding danger.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Dude! They're all around me! What
do I do? WHAT DO I DO?!
Mikey's eyes continue to panic. DONATELLO's voice comes in
over a RADIO. Calming.

                                   DONATELLO (O.S.)
                         Just relax, Mikey. Remember your
training. You'll be fine.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         But I need back up this time, man!

                         BACK UP!

                                   DONATELLO (O.S.)

                             (SIGHS)
                         ...you're such a prima donna.

               INT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

The cam pulls out of a LARGE MASCOT HEAD - looks like a big
goofy Turtle head with googly eyes and dumb smile. WIDER we
see a fake ZIPPER spirit-glued onto Mikey's plastron. In his
hands, he holds two nerf-styled NUNCHUCKS.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                             (from inside mascot head)
Okay - waita-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA!!
Suddenly TEN KIDS WITH BIRTHDAY HATS AND FOAM NUNCHUCKS run
in SCREAMING and start beating on Mikey... a little too hard.

                                   SCREAMING KIDS
                         Get him! Yeah! You suck! Hey!
Awright! Take that, Turtle-dork!

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         OH-WHOA! OW! YEOW-OW-OW! WATCH IT!!

                         HEY! NOT BELOW THE-OOOFF!! OW!!
               End WIDER with the kids all walking away from Mikey, now on
the floor doubled over from the "playing". A beat, then-
-one more kid runs back and kicks Mikey.

                                   LITTLE GIRL

                         KEEEEYA!

This was the best birthday ever,

Mikey GROANS as we-

               EXT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - SUNSET/LATER

Beautiful downtown autumnal street. Parked in front, we see
the "COWABUNGA CARL" PARTY VAN loudly decorated in kid-
friendly colors with an embarrassing and low-tech looking
TURTLE HEAD ON TOP. PUSH IN on upstairs apartment window.

penny. I have to tell all my
friends about you. You'll love
their kids too.

Mascot Mikey is standing at the door, holding a fistful of
cash, still in full costume.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         I can only hope they're as lovely
as the rugrats you got here.
ON KIDS - They look tough, brandishing their nerf weapons - a
toddler street gang. One of the kids does a finger-point-then-
throat-slit gesture. The mom looks and beams. The kids
quickly smile to cover.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                             (through gritted teeth)
Such... angels.
Mikey looks to the side, and sees the still piled-high stack
of PIZZA BOXES through the fake head POV.

                                   SOCCER MOM
                         Okay! Everyone say good-bye to
Cowabunga Carl! BYE!

                             (put-on voice)
Hyuk! Cowabunga dudes! Bye!

                                     KIDS

                         BYE!!!!!!
               ON DOOR - As the door closes and Mom turns back, a green hand
reaches in quickly a grabs a box of pizza. The door closes.

                                   MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                         Heheh... score.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               Mikey opens the van's rear doors. He PULLS OFF the fake
zipper on his chest and then pulls off his fake turtle head.
His trademark orange bandana spills out.
He turns, breathing in the fresh surface air. A quiet beat
until - A POLICE SIREN approaches, faint, in the distance.
Mikey jumps in the van, slams the door shut as the car
whizzes by.
WIDER - the van takes off down the street.



                                                                       11.

face thing.

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - LATER

CLOSE ON - a regular motorist sitting in his car at a traffic
light. Don monitors from a small dashboard cam. Man looks OS
Left. Reacts.
OFF HIS LOOK - We see Mikey beside him in the van. He's
behind the wheel - face FROZEN in a goofy SMILE like a
ventriloquist to "hide" his identity. Don follows on a small
surveillance cam under the rearview mirror.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Yes... sir.

                                   DONATELLO (O.S.)
                         That's a good boy.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         All's I'm saying Donnie is that no
one would notice if YOU did one of
these gigs every now and again.

                                    DONATELLO (O.S.)
                         But you add such... panache to the
character.
Mikey, emotional, pops into "fully animated" facial mode. He
rubs his sore neck.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Well, if panache is French for
"punching bag", I'd have to agree
with ya.

               A darkened room lit only by the lights of dozens of tv's,
monitors and TV tubes. Cables run everywhere. In front of
them is DONATELLO - our resident tech-head turtle.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Close enough. I - uh-oh-
ON MONITOR - Don watches Mikey through a TRAFFIC CAM in front
of the van. Don is jacked into every major security and
surveillance camera in the city.

               ON CAR - The Man is still looking - only now really freaked
out - at the fully animated Mikey head.

                                    MICHAELANGELO
                         Aw nuts.
Mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight SMILE,
frozen. He looks over and waves at the man who confusingly
waves back.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                             (ventriloquist style)
Just get me outta here, dude.
ON DON - He hits some switches. Monitors change.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Traffic's clear eastbound for two
blocks. Then hook up with route J.
BACK WITH MIKEY - He's still waving with a frozen smile.

                                    ICHAELANGELO
                             (ventriloquist style)
Righteous.
Mikey immediately "unfreezes" and sticks his tongue out and
antics at the Man! Before the man can react, Mikey TEARS OUT
and zips across traffic down a deserted side-street.
...as we notice the annoying ice cream style music tinkering

                                    M
               along with his gaining speed.

                                    ICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                         You HAD to install the music too...

                                   DONATELLO (O.S.)
                         All part of the cover, my friend.

                                                                  CUT TO:

               The van parks in a long-forgotten alleyway. A dummy gate
closes behind it, obscuring it from view.
UNDER THE VAN - We see it's parked over a manhole cover. It
slowly slides shut.

               The dripping concrete and metal maze explodes with the
cacophony of Mikey riding his skateboard, backpack in tow.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         YEEEEEHAAAAAAWWWW!!

               But this isn't just any half-pipe - it tests all of Mikey's
skills in ninjitsu, extreme sports and cross-training. He
jumps on and off the board to occasionally tackle obstacles
with all four limbs. A fun rock n' roll sequence.
Feels like Mikey is miles away from the surface world when he
arrives at a seemingly DEAD END. He smiles as he reveals a
BRICK DUMMY WALL that brings him to...

               Mikey lands in the "foyer" of sorts. Atop entrance stairs. He
kicks the double doors open.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Honeeeeey! I'm hooome!
As Mikey slides down the banister, the cam dollies around

               I
               behind him revealing the LAIR. Breathtaking to fresh eyes.
t has a wonderful lived-in feel - they're not squatters...
they've made this their HOME. Furniture is jury-rigged and
the place is custom lit to provide the right kind of
atmosphere. If we looked behind the surface detail, we'd see
a mesh of wires and circuitry powering the entire lair.
Donatello runs up to Mikey. Mikey robotically hands him the
wad of money from the party.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Moneymoneymoneymoney.
As Donnie walks away, Mikey LOUDLY CLEARS HIS THROAT. Don
stops as Mikey holds out his hand. Don's busted - he peels
off a few bills and hands Mikey his share.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Domo arigato, dude.
Mikey walks into the room and plops down on a sofa. Hits a
remote as a BIG SCREEN lights up in front of him. Suddenly-

                                   SPLINTER (O.S.)

                         MICHAELANGELO!
               Mikey springs from the couch. Snaps to obedience.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Yes, sensei.
ANGLE ON - SPLINTER the Japanese rodent master and father of
the TMNT. He is well-kempt, still walks with a cane, and has
the same sparkle in his eye. He approaches Mikey. Silent.

                                   SPLINTER
                             (a beat)
Well?



               P









                                                                        14.

                         Sensei?
(thinks, then realizes)
Oh! Here ya go, Master Splinter.
Mikey reaches into his bag and removes a foil-wrapped piece
of BIRTHDAY CAKE. Splinter lights up.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Ahh! Butter creme frosting!
Donatello walks to Splinter. Holds his hand out, judgmental.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Master. No cake. You remember your
last cholesterol tests.

                                   SPLINTER
                         But I-
(changes attitude)
-Donatello! I am your Master!

                                   DONATELLO
                         Nice try, sensei. But you can still
be my Master... with low
cholesterol.
Splinter surrenders the cake. As Don walks away,
Michaelangelo reaches into his bag and secretly passes
Splinter a smaller wrapped piece.

                                   SPLINTER
                         He-heh. You have done well, my son.
Donatello walks to the fridge and opens it - FILLED with
dozens of other pieces of Birthday Cake leftovers. He tosses
it with the rest.                                  C

                                                                  UT TO:

               The street noise below is barely audible. Camera creeps along
the edge of the building, reaching a row of GARGOYLES.
AN ALONG GARGOYLES - Still. Concrete. Creepy. Just as we
pass the fourth, we barely notice it's WHITE EYES OPENING.
QUICK SNAP BACK TO GARGOYLE - Only now it's gone. Something
strange is coming to town...

CAM LOWERS - as APRIL O'NEIL leaps down into frame. Dressed
in jungle expedition gear with her head wrapped in a bandana.
She takes off her sunglasses and admires the crate.
ON BOX - Labelled "O'Neil Cargo". Something ominous about the
crate. PUSH IN on it as April steps in front. Admires it with
pride. Turns, takes out a cell phone, and hits speed dial.
ON PHONE DISPLAY - "Calling HOME". It rings.

                                   APRIL
                             (impatient mutter)
Where are you?





               INT. APRIL AND CASEY'S LOFT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS


          24                                                               24
               A spacious NYC loft - tons of bookcases work as room
dividers. Piled with artifacts, unopened crates of all sizes,
boxes of maps, and a general organized mess. A hockey game
BLARES from a TV set.
CAM PANS ACROSS ROOM - The telephone continues to ring just
as we reach the KITCHEN - with piles of dirty dishes and fast
food. And then a path of strewn clothes that gets messier and
messier until we reach -
- CASEY JONES, snoring on a sofa. He finally wakes up,
clamors for the phone, tripping over mess in the process.

                                    C

                                     ASEY

                             (GROGGY)
                         Talk to me.

                                   APRIL
                         Hey. It's me. I'm back.
Casey rubs his face, tries to orient himself. Looks at watch.

                                   CASEY
                         Was that today, babe?
April's disappointed. Same old Casey.



               O









                                                                       16.







                                    APRIL
                         Yes. It was today that I returned
to you after being in a deadly
jungle for almost a month.

                             (BEAT)
                         I thought you were going to meet me
down here?

                                   CASEY
                         I'm sorry, babe. I must've-

                                   APRIL
                         Forget it. I'll take a cab.
A long pause on the phone. Casey knows he's busted.

                                   CASEY
                         I missed you?
April doesn't answer. She closes the phone. Casey slumps in
his chair, shaking his head.

                                   CASEY
                         Good goin', Case.
Back at the dock, April is back to business.

                                   APRIL
                         Howie! Get this on the truck for
delivery! Let's go!
P.O.V. INSIDE BOX - See April through the wood slats. We'd
swear we almost hear... LOW GROWLING.

                                                                 CUT TO:





               INT. MIKEY'S BEDROOM - LATER

               Mikey is on his bed. His thumbs pound away at a video game on
TV - bored. He puts down the controller and yells to the
ceiling.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         I'M! BORED!!!!!
               He stands up and walks to DON'S ROOM. He opens it. It takes
only one foot until the door is pushed up against piles of
TECH JUNK. Mikey uses his shoulder and pushes it open.
N DON - He's hunched over a work table, back to Mikey.
Tinkering as always. Wild inventions line the walls, some
finished, some not. Some pay tribute to past TMNT adventures.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Don, y'ever feel like you were
meant for more? To DO more? Like, I
mean, sometimes I feel like...

                              MICHAELANGELO(cont'd)
like we never really left that
glass turtle bowl when we were
little dudes.
REVERSE ANGLE - Don lifts his head up, eyes MAGNIFIED in some
bizarre head contraption. He flips up side panels,
ELECTRONICA MUSIC blares out.

                               ONATELLO
                    Oh, hi Mikey. You say something?

                              MICHAELANGELO
                        (sighs - to himself)
Every day it's the same thing. Wake
up. Birthday party gig. Drive home.
Watch TV. Train... Rinse. Repeat.

                              DONATELLO
                    I know. Isn't it great?
A beat. Mikey sighs, then walks back downstairs to the LIVING
ROOM SOFA. He and the camera think he's alone, but before he
knows it, Splinter is sitting next to him, cross legged,
still, and sipping tea.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    WAH!!

                              SPLINTER
                    Michaelangelo. Boredom is never an
indicator of your surroundings. It
is a reflection of your inner
heart. Fill yourself with
excitement on the inside... and
you'll live the most rewarding life
of all.
Mikey stares at Splinter, dead pan. A beat. Then returns to
flipping channels. He stops on a NEWS program - "NYC DIRT".

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER (O.S.)
                    And so yet again, police officials
are baffled at a crime of
retribution that can only be
attributed to the mysterious figure
M         known as "The Nightwatcher".
ikey lights up. On TV is a flashy well-coifed, know-nothing
REPORTER. Beside him is a news photo of the tied up MUGGER
from our second scene.

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER
                    This is the latest in a string of
vigilante acts that have been
plaguing the city for the past
year.

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER(cont'd)
Although the victims have been
criminals themselves, the
Nightwatcher's actions have been
identified as destructive and
overly-violent... verging on the
edge of lethal.
ON MIKEY - Can't smile wide enough. He runs to his room,
returns with a POLAROID CAMERA. He snaps a picture of the TV.
He pulls it out, placing it in his NIGHTWATCHER SCRAPBOOK,
overflowing with paper clippings and articles on the
vigilante.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!
Cruising the streets, busting those
who hold themselves above the law.
(movie announcer voice)
But they aren't above HIS.
Don walks in, holding an in-process invention. He looks up.

                              DONATELLO
                    Mikey, the man's practically a
criminal himself. Anyone who
operates without boundary or rule
of law cannot be legislated and
needs to be reigned in.

                              RAPHAEL (O.S.)
                    Sounds like four turtles I used ta
know.
ON DOOR - Raphael walks in, his Nightwatcher costume no where
in sight.

                               RAPHAEL
                    Whatta we talkin' about, boys?
Soundin' a little too egghead fer
my tastes.

                               PLINTER
                    Ah, Raphael. Your brothers and I
were just discussing the vigilante
Nightwatcher once again.
(beat - concerned)
Where have you been? You've been
spending so much time away from
home lately...
Raphael's on edge from the mention of Nightwatcher already.
His attention doesn't break from Donatello.

                              RAPHAEL
                    I joined a book a' the month club.
(to Donnie)
So just what's your beef with
puttin' dirtbags behind bars,
Donnie? Go ahead... enlighten me.

          Splinter watches the growing tension with concern.

                              DONATELLO
                    I have no problem with the
incarceration of those who deserve
it, but if someone like
Nightwatcher has ultimate power...
then who makes sure he doesn't
cross the line?
Mikey picks up two NINJA BLADE RINGS, twirling them around
aggressively in mock battle.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    I think he's COOL.

                              DONATELLO
                    Of course you would.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                        (in bg, oblivious)
Keeya! HATCHAAAAAA!!

                              RAPHAEL
                    Sometimes there are lines that even
the police can't cross. Someone has
to be willing to do what needs to
be done. And to do that, fear
becomes a weapon.

                              DONATELLO
                    You are such a Neanderthal.
Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don. Don reacts quick
and startled, eyes wide.

                                APHAEL
                    I rest my case.

                              S

                               PLINTER

                        (SCOLDING)
                    Raphael! If bullying is the only
way to argue your point, then
perhaps you do not have much of a
point to begin with.

                               APHAEL
                        (gritted teeth)
Yes, sensei.
(to Mikey)
And quit touchin' my stuff.
Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms
out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the
second floor.



                                                                          20.







                                   DONATELLO
                             (too-late-retort to Raph)
That was just a startle response
and isn't really an indication of
fear!
Raph does the "blah blah" hand gesture from above. Enters his
room, slams the door and immediately BLASTS MUSIC...
...and it's some annoying pop HIP-HOP song.

                                   RAPHAEL (O.S.)

                         AAAARGH! AND STOP TOUCHING MY

                         STEREO TOO, MIKEY!!!
               Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing to drown out his family. A
silence sits in the room as a CD flies out of Raph's room.
Tense in the room for a bit. Don looks at the other two.

                                   DONATELLO
                         It's an involuntary thing your body
does when stimulated like that.
(no response)
What? It's true.

                                                                 CUT TO:





               EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT


          26                                                                26
               A large JET LINER flies into the city. Lowering. The wheels
fold out under the carriages.
CLOSER - LEO is on the landing gear, his face lit up by the
city glow in front of him. He jumps off as - FOOMP! - a HANG-
GLIDER opens up from his backpack. He lowers the glider to
the water and RELEASES!





               INT. SEWER PIPE - MOMENTS LATER


          27                                                                27
               Disgusting. Dripping. Out of the slime, Leo rises. A beat...
inhales, then SMILES WIDE.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Mmm... home sweet home.





               INT. TURTLES LAIR - NIGHT

               All is peaceful in the lair. The big screen TV is the only
light source. Mikey snores and drools on the couch, covered
in junk food wrappers. Donnie sleeps with an "TECH HEAD"
magazine over his face... gadget-in-process in his lap.
ON ENTRANCE - Leo walks in and places his bag on the floor.
The place feels different... but still feels like home.



               S









                                                                       21.




               He tiptoes with ninjitsu precision across the floor, avoiding
the potential noise-making mess below him. He sneaks to-





               INT. SPLINTER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          29                                                               29
               Leo peers in cautiously. Splinter is still awake. Expecting
him. Kneeling on the floor. Very serious.

                                    SPLINTER
                         Enter.
Leo walks in and kneels in front of Splinter.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I have completed my training,
master. I am prepared for the next
stage.

                                   SPLINTER
                         That you are, my son. You must now
apply all that you have learned on
your lengthy journey to your
everyday life. THAT will be the
most challenging training of all...
plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an ANCIENT MEDALLION.
Leo is touched.
CLOSE ON SHADOWS OUTSIDE OF ROOM - We see a pair of EYES,
watching the entire scene... jealous.

                                   SPLINTER
                         I've missed you, Leonardo.

               L
                eo hugs Splinter.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I've missed you too, father.

                                   SPLINTER
                         I'm afraid much has changed in your
brothers' spirits since you have
left. But now that you are home,
they will finally have the ethical
and warrior leadership they have
been lacking. The family needs you.
ON LEO - He swallows that big pill very hard.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Heh. Yeah... I mean, yes sensei.

                                   SPLINTER
                             (to doorway)

          ON OUTSIDE OF ROOM - Raphael walks out of the shadows. He's
good... but not too good for Splinter. Splinter and Leo break
and face the doorway. An awkward silence.

                                  LEONARDO
                       Hey.

                                  RAPHAEL
                       Hey.
Raphael eyes Leo... and then the medallion.

                                 RAPHAEL
                       So... congratulations.

                           (awkward beat/fake yawn)
Well, I'm goin' to bed.
He leaves.
TV ROOM - Raph walks through the room, cuffs Don on the back
of the head, and keeps on walking.

                                 RAPHAEL
                       Leo's home.
Donatello wakes up, looks around. LIGHTS UP when he sees Leo.

                       Leo!!
ON MIKEY - He wakes up. A Cheese Doodle stuck to his upper
snout. Really groggy.

birthday cake, Mrs. Ro-

                       LEOOOOO!!!
          Mikey flips past Donnie and slams Leo with a gripping HUG...
and doesn't let go.

               It was all a nightmare. We go WIDER as we take in the
ostentatious bedroom of MAXIMILIAN WINTERS, a young mid-40's.
Famous NYC entrepreneur.
inters is large, handsome, built and powerful in every
sense. His bedroom reflects it as well - large simple shapes,
decorated with a modern-day tribal/tech appeal. This guy is
filled with adrenaline, power and machismo.

ON DOORWAY - Standing there is a beautiful black-haired
assistant dressed in full suit and tie with a clipboard.

               Rock/hip-hop music crashes in as we see Winters' morning
workout - a combination of weaponry work (martial arts and
others), floor routines and bag work. He takes it all very
seriously.
Sequence ends with him smashing the top off of a Mook Jung
training block with his bare fist. He walks out of the room,
grabbing a towel from a blonde assistant.

               Winters walks in his crisp suit. His office is large and
austere. Two levels of history in books, artifacts, warrior
themed curios and power.

He slowly LOWERS OUT OF FRAME. CAM PULLS OUT WIDER REVEALING -
Winters Office is an "elevator" of sorts that can ride up
and down the front of the building, allowing him access to
any floor of his Tower without leaving his desk.
WIDER - see the Tower is a monolith in the middle of
Manhattan - complete with it's own front Central Park-ish
gated entry. A true work of modern architecture.

                                                                WIPE TO:

               We see the wonder of everything Winters - mixing of old
artifacts with modern day aesthetic and implementation. The
ceilings are vast and there is no mistaking the worth of the
man and his company.

though Winters stands at the head of an ARMY AT ATTENTION.

Leo walks along the upper floor of their lair. As he passes
Mikey's room, his brother pops out with his skateboard. We
follow them as they walk down to the TV area.

                         Just enjoying being home.
hey walk past Donnie's Chop Shop room as - BOOM! - something
explodes and smoke pours out under his door.

Casey? I expected them to drop by
after I got back.

                         We don't see much of `em anymore.
April seems to be working a lot -
eww - and Casey seems to be, I
dunno, "different" lately. Maybe he
doesn't like having to put the
toilet seat down now that they've
moved in together.

They get to the living room area. Mikey walks to the edge of
a jury-rigged HALF-PIPE he built in an old water slough.
Mikey continues as he skates back and forth.

buzzkills to be around.

checking and all the requisite boy things. We see that the
kids love Casey. And vice versa. Suddenly-

business suit at the other side of the street. She's dangling
a WHITE SHIRT and a TIE from her other hand.

Winters BEAMS, way too excited as well. April holds out her
hand to Casey, who doesn't know what she wants. He awkwardly
HIGH FIVES her.

He hands it to April as she twirls up a CROW-BAR and cracks
open the front panel.

                         I've been so grateful for the
opportunities you've given me
lately. I'd probably be still
selling antique curios if you
hadn't visited my shop that day.
(off of box)
But I have to ask... why the
fascination with these particular
works of art? I'd never even heard
of the Legend of Yaotl until we
met.
He looks up. The cam PANS RIGHT. It travels past an SUIT OF
ARMOR in the FG. Goes to BLACK. Continue PAN until we're in-

               EXT. FLASHBACK BATTLEFIELD - 3000 YEARS AGO

-the armor becomes the back of a HELMET. Camera dollies
around the helmet until we're looking at a dark and imposing
figure. YAOTL. His helmet is impenetrable, with eye slits.
Note - the flashback is dark, shadowed and monochromed.
Detail is hinted at instead of shown. Very stylized.

                         It was a time long before the
Mayans, April. Long before the
Aztecs and even the Olmecs. It was
a time of legends. A time of
greatness. The true mother culture
of Central America.
Cool shots of Yaotl. His armor, his stance, etc.

                                    INTERS (V.O.)
                         There was a man named Yaotl. More a
force of nature than man. And
together with his Four Warrior-
Priest Generals, they pillaged
every culture in their path.
QUICK SHOTS OF EACH GENERAL. The walk along side Yoatl.
Possibly slo-mo. We will come to recognize them through their
distinct armor as the Four Stone Generals - in human form.

                         And for every culture they
destroyed, they drank in all the
magic and knowledge known to them.

They became a warring hurricane,
gathering more power and knowledge
with each conquest.
GROUP SHOT - Of five Warriors. High atop a hillside, finally
stopped. Ready for battle. Their character-specific weapons
are drawn. Around them is a small army of MINIONS.

                                WINTERS (V.O.)
                    Then they came across a culture
rich with science, magic and their
own technology. A South American
version of "Atlantis".

                        (

                          BEAT)
                    It was like blood in the water for
a predator like Yaotl.
CLOSE ON - Yaotl. As he raises his sword in the air. CAM
DOLLIES AROUND HIS HEAD REVEALING their opposing forces. An
army of THOUSANDS. Waving their weapons in the air.
The opposing army CHARGES. Yaotl's men pull out   a large
ORNAMENTAL STAND - a "stargate" of sorts. Yaotl   and his men
are unmoving... as they begin a ceremony. Yaotl   looks to the
heavens above - as we see a CLUSTER OF SPECIFIC   STARS move
into place.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    As the army approached, Yaotl used
the knowledge they'd gained in
black magic and sorcery. Timing
their attack with the alignment of
the Stars of Kikin, they opened a
portal to another world.
ON CHARGING ARMY - they stop dead in their tracks. Front-lit
by the OS portal. Don't know what to expect -
ON PORTAL - A crackling electric circle opens to another
dimension. Suddenly - DOZENS OF MONSTERS EXPLODE OUT!
Creatures of all varieties. Gnashing Fangs. Swiping claws.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    They unleashed an army of monsters.
N BATTLEFIELD - men getting slaughtered (in a nice PG sort
of way). Quick shots. Intense.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    The monsters knew no side   - they
destroyed the enemy... as   well as
Yaotl's own army. Men who   swore to
spill their blood for his   cause.
