Revised Third Draft

July 15, 1991



               FADE IN:

               EXT. A SENTRY TOWER --

-- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.

Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower 
cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable 
sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very 
faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, 
we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible 
now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the 
steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure 
and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT 
POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.

Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding 
a rifle and staring straight out.

The drum cadence has been building slightly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight 
that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into 
the distance.

               SUBTITLE: UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA.

The drum cadence continues, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A MARINE BARRACKS

We HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR

where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, 
two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop 
when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still 
growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it 
slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into

               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT

WILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in 
his bunk.

DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S 
shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks 
at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --

-- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out 
of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and 
DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come 
out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.

Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision 
and professionalism.

-- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto 
his mouth and eyes --

-- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (quietly)
You're lucky it's us, Willy.

-- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking 
him, just holding his head still --

-- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo. We HEAR four 
sharp blasts from a whistle and we

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - DAY

and the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper 
Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a 
sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished 
silver and brass.

The BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds 
before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS.

As the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from 
various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game. 
Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were 
all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same 
fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM 
that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works.

               SUBTITLE: THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD, WASHINGTON, D.C.

                                                                    CUT TO:

HIGH ANGLE of the entire band an we end credits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A RED BRICK BUILDING - DAY

It's an important building, a main building. A few SAILORS 
enter and exit and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A WOMAN

as she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building.  
The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early 
30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency 
to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her 
JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ...

                                     JO
                         I'm requesting... I'm... Captain, 
I'd like to request that I be the 
attorney assigned to rep -- I'd like 
to request that it be myself who is 
assigned to represent --
(she stops)
"That it be myself who is assigned 
to represent"? ...Good, Jo, that's 
confidence inspiring.

We follow JO, still muttering, as she walks into the brick 
building which bears the seal of the

               UNITED STATES NAVY - JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL'S CORPS

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WEST'S OFFICE - DAY

As JO  enters. CAPTAIN WEST and two other officers, GIBBS 
and LAWRENCE, sit around a conference table.

                                     GIBBS
                         Jo, come on in.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     GIBBS
                         Captain West, this is Lt. Commander 
Galloway. Jo, you know Mike Lawrence.

                                     JO
                         Yes sir.
(to WEST)
Captain, I appreciate your seeing me 
on such short notice.

                                     WEST
                         I understand there was some trouble 
over the weekend down in Cuba.

                                     JO
                         Yes sir... This past Friday evening.  
Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson 
and Private Louden Downey, entered 
the barracks room of a PFC William 
Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago 
died at the base hospital 
approximately an hour later. The NIS 
agent who took their statements 
maintains they were trying to prevent 
Santiago from naming them in a 
fenceline shooting incident. They're 
scheduled to have a hearing down in 
Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         What's the problem?

                                     JO
                         Dawson and Downey are both recruiting 
poster marines and Santiago was known 
to be a screw-up. I was thinking 
that it sounded an awful lot like a 
code red.

Jo lets this sink in a moment.

                                     WEST
                              (under his breath)
Christ.

                                     JO
                         I'd like them moved up to Washington 
and assigned counsel. Someone who 
can really look into this. Someone 
who possesses not only the legal 
skill, but a familiarity with the 
inner workings of the military. In 
short, Captain, I'd like to suggest 
that... I be the one who, that it be 
me who is assigned to represent them.
(beat)
Myself.

Jo looks around the room for a response.

                                     WEST
                         Joanne, why don't you get yourself a 
cup of coffee.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir, I'm fine.

                                     WEST
                         Joanne, I'd like you to leave the 
room so we can talk about you behind 
your back.

                                     JO
                         Certainly, sir.

JO gets up and walks out.

                                     WEST
                         I thought this Code Red shit wasn't 
going on anymore.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         With the marines at GITMO? Who the 
hell knows what goes on down there.

                                     WEST
                         Well lets find out before the rest 
of the world does, this thing could 
get messy. What about this woman?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Jo's been working a desk at internal 
affairs for what, almost a year now.

                                     WEST
                         And before that?

                                     GIBBS
                         She disposed of three cases in two 
years.

                                     WEST
                         Three cases in two years? Who was 
she handling, the Rosenbergs?

                                     GIBBS
                         She's not cut out for litigation.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         She's a hall of an investigator, 
Jerry --

                                     GIBBS
                         In Internal Affairs, sure. She can 
crawl up a lawyer's ass with the 
best of 'em, but when it comes to 
trial work --

                                     WEST
                         I know. All passion, no street smarts. 
Bring her back in.

LAWRENCE goes to the door and motions for JO to come back 
in.

                                     WEST
                              (continuing)
Commander, we're gonna move the 
defendants up here in the morning.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     WEST
                         And I'll have Division assign them 
counsel...

                                     JO
                              (beat)
But... not me.

                                     WEST
                         From what I understand from your 
colleagues, you're much too valuable 
in your present assignment to be 
wasted on what I'm sure will boil 
down to a five minute plea bargain 
and a week's worth of paper work.

                                     JO
                         Sir --

                                     WEST
                         Don't worry about it. I promise you, 
division'll assign the right man for 
the job.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

               THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB

His name is LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE DANIEL ALLISTAIR KAFFEE, 
and it's almost impossible not to like him. At the moment 
he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread 
out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27 
Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own 
against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.

KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law 
School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous 
spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, 
passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (calling out to the 
team)
Alright, let's get two!

He smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right 
between his legs.

                                     SECOND BASE
                         Sorry!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.  
Just look the ball into your glove.

He smacks one out to the same place. It bounces off the heel 
of SHERBY's glove and into center field.

                                     SECOND BASE (SHERBY)
                         Sorry!

                                     KAFFEE
                         You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep 
your eyes open, your chances of 
catching the ball increase by a factor 
of ten.

SPRADLING, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath, 
walks up behind the backstop.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let's try it again.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee!!

                                     KAFFEE
                              (turning)
Dave. You seem upset and distraught.

                                     SPRADLING
                         We were supposed to meet in your 
office 15 minutes ago to talk about 
the McDermott case. You're stalling 
on this thing. Now we got this done 
and I mean now, or no kidding, Kaffee, 
I'll hang your boy from a fuckin' 
yardarm.

                                     KAFFEE
                         A yardarm?
(calling out)
Sherby, does the Navy still hang 
people from yardarms?

                                     SHERBY
                              (calling back)
I don't think so, Danny.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (back to SPRADLING)
Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy 
hangs people from yardarms anymore.
(back to the field)
Let's go, let's get two!

He goes back to hitting fungoes.

                                     SPRADLING
                         I'm gonna charge him with possession 
and being under the influence while 
on duty. Plead guilty and I'll 
recommend 30 days in the brig with 
loss of rank and pay.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It was oregano, Dave, it was ten 
dollars worth of oregano.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Yeah, well your client thought it 
was marijuana.

                                     KAFFEE
                         My client's a moron, that's not 
against the law.

Swapp! The THIRD BASEMAN takes one in the face.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
Ow. That had to hurt.
(calling out)
Way to keep your head in the play, 
Lester. Walk it off!

                                     SPRADLING
                         I've got people to answer to just 
like you, I'm gonna charge him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         With what, possession of a condiment?

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dave, I've tried to help you out of 
this, but if you ask for tall time, 
I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

                                     SPRADLING
                         You won't got it.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I will get it. And if the MTD is 
denied, I'll file a motion in liminee 
seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling 
in advance, and after that I'm gonna 
file against pre-trial confinement, 
and you're gonna spend an entire 
summer going blind on paperwork 
because a Signalman Second Class 
bought and smoked a dime bag of 
oregano.

                                     SPRADLING
                         B Misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig.

                                     KAFFEE
                         C Misdemeanor, 15 days restricted 
duty.

                                     SPRADLING
                         I don't know why I'm agreeing to 
this.

                                     KAFFEE
                         'Cause you have wisdom beyond your 
years. Dave, can you play third base?

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

About 16 NAVY AND MARINE LAWYERS (several of whom are women) 
are taking their seats around a large conference table.

A PARALEGAL is handing out folders and some photocopied papers 
to the LAWYERS.

We might notice that one of the lawyers is Lieutenant Junior 
Grade SAM WEINBERG. Sam's serious and studious looking. If 
he weren't in uniform, you wouldn't guess that he was a naval 
officer.

CAPTAIN WHITAKER walks in.

                         'Morning.

                                     LAWYERS
                              (school class)
'Morning Captain Whitaker.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sam, how's the baby?

                                     SAM
                         I think she's ready to say her first 
word any day now.

                                     WHITAKER
                         How can you tell?

                                     SAM
                         She just looks like she has something 
to say.

KAFFEE walks in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Excuse me, sorry I'm late.

                                     WHITAKER
                         I'm sure you don't have a good excuse, 
so I won't force you to come up with 
a bad one.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you, Isaac, that's nice of 
you.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sit-down, this first one's for you.

He hands KAFFEE some files.

                                     WHITAKER
                              (continuing)
You're moving up in the world, Danny, 
you've been requested by Division.

"Oooh"'s and "Ahhh"'S from the other LAWYERS. (Subtle Note: 
Kaffee doesn't want to move up in the world.)

                                     KAFFEE
                         Requested to do what?

WHITAKER hands him a file.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A marine 
corporal named Dawson illegally fires 
a round from his weapon over the 
fenceline and into Cuban territory.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's a fenceline?

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sam?

                                     SAM
                         A big wall separating the good guys 
from the bad guys.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Teachers pet.

                                     WHITAKER
                         PFC William Santiago threatens to 
rat on Dawson to the Naval 
investigative Service. Dawson and 
another member of his squad, PFC 
Louden Downey, they go into Santiago's 
room, tie him up, and stuff a rag 
down his throat. An hour later, 
Santiago's dead. Attending physician 
says the rag was treated with some 
kind of toxin.

                                     KAFFEE
                         They poisoned the rag?

                                     WHITAKER
                         Not according to them.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do they say?

                                     WHITAKER
                         Not much. They're being flown up 
here tomorrow and on Thursday at 
0600 you'll catch a transport down 
to Cuba for the day to find out what 
you can. Meantime, go across the 
yard and see Lt. Commander Joanne 
Galloway. She's the one who had 'em 
brought up here. She'll fill you in 
on whatever she has. Any questions?

                                     KAFFEE
                         The flight to Cuba, was that 0600 in 
the morning, sir?

                                     WHITAKER
                         It seems important to Division that 
this one be handled by the book, so 
I'm assigning co-counsel. Any 
volunteers?

                                     SAM
                         No.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sam.

                                     SAM
                         I have a stack of paper on my desk --

                                     WHITAKER
                         Work with Kaffee on this.

                                     SAM
                         Doing what? Kaffee'll finish this up 
in four days.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Do various... administrative... you 
know... things. Back-up. Whatever.

                                     SAM
                         In other words I have no 
responsibilities whatsoever.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Right.

                                     SAM
                         My kinda case.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JO'S OFFICE - DAY

JO sits behind her desk. KAFFEE and SAM stand in the doorway. 
KAFFEE knocks politely.

JO looks up.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Hi.
(beat)
I'm Daniel Kaffee. I was told to 
meet with --
(checks notes)
-- Commander Galloway.

JO is staring at him. KAFFEE doesn't know why.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
About a briefing.

JO is finding this hard to believe.

                                     JO
                         You're the attorney that Division 
assigned?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm lead counsel. This is Sam 
Weinberg.

                                     SAM
                         I have no responsibilities here 
whatsoever.

JO's deeply puzzled.

                                     JO
                              (beat)
Come in, please, have a seat...

KAFFEE and SAM come into the office and sit.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
Lieutenant, how long have you been 
in the Navy?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Going on nine months now.

                                     JO
                         And how long have you been out of 
law school?

                                     KAFFEE
                         A little over a year.

                                     JO
                              (beat)
I see.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Have I done something wrong?

                                     JO
                         No. It's just that when I petitioned 
Division to have counsel assigned, I 
was hoping I'd be taken seriously.

KAFFEE and SAM exchange a look.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to JO)
No offense taken, if you were 
wondering.

                                     SAM
                         Commander, Lt. Kaffee's generally 
considered the best litigator in our 
office. He's successfully plea 
bargained 44 cases in nine months.

                                     KAFFEE
                         One more, and I got a set of steak 
knives.

                                     JO
                         Have you ever been in a courtroom?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I once had my drivers license 
suspended.

                                     SAM
                         Danny --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander, from what I understand, 
if this thing goes to court, they 
won't need a lawyer, they'll need a 
priest.

                                     JO
                         No. They'll need a lawyer.

During this, she'll hand KAFFEE a series of files, which 
KAFFEE will pass To SAM without even glancing at them.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
Dawson's family has been contacted.  
Downey's closest living relative is 
Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's 
side, she hasn't been Contacted yet.

None of this really means anything to KAFFEE.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
Would you like me to take care of 
that?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sure, if you feel like it.

JO takes another beat to size this guy up.

                                     JO
                         One of the people you'll be speaking 
to down there is the barracks C.O., 
Colonel Nathan Jessep, I assume you've 
heard of him.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
Who hasn't?

                                     SAM
                              (to KAFFEE)
He's been in the papers lately. He's 
expected to be appointed Director of 
Operations for the National Security 
Counsel.

Passing KAFFEE another file --

                                     JO
                         These are letters that Santiago wrote 
in his 8 months at GITMO --

                                     SAM
                              (whispering to kaffee)
Guantanamo Bay.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I know that one.

                                     JO
                         He wrote to his recruiter, the fleet 
commander, HQ, Atlantic, even his 
senator. He wanted a transfer. Nobody 
was listening. You with me?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes.

                                     JO
                         This last letter to the Naval 
investigative Service --

She hands it to KAFFEE who hands it to Sam --

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
-- where he offers information about 
Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting 
in exchange for a transfer, was just 
a last ditch effort.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Right. Is that all?

                                     JO
                              (beat)
Lieutenant, this letter makes it 
look like your client had a motive 
to kill Santiago.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Gotcha.
(beat)
And Santiago is... who?

                                     JO
                              (beat)
The victim.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to SAM)
Write that down.
(to JO)
Am I correct in assuming that these 
letters don't paint a flattering 
picture of marine corps life in 
Guantanamo Bay?

                                     JO
                         Yes, among other --

                                     KAFFEE
                         And am I further right in assuming 
that a protracted investigation of 
this incident might cause some 
embarrassment for the security counsel 
guy.

                                     JO
                         Colonel Jessep, yes, but --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Twelve years.

                                     JO
                         I'm sorry?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Twelve years. I can get it knocked 
down to Involuntary Manslaughter. 
Twelve years.

                                     JO
                         You haven't talked to a witness, you 
haven't looked at a piece of paper.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Pretty impressive, huh?

                                     JO
                         You're gonna have to go deeper than 
just --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander, do you have some sort of 
jurisdiction here that I should know 
about?

                                     JO
                         My job is to make sure you do your 
job. I'm special counsel for Internal 
Affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty 
much in your face. Read the letters. 
You're not under any obligation, but 
I'd appreciate a report when you get 
back from Cuba.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sure.

KAFFEE gets up without waiting for JO to say --

                                     JO
                         You're dismissed.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sorry, I always forget that.

KAFFEE's gone. SAM's standing in the doorway.

                                     SAM
                         He's a little preoccupied.

                         Tell your friend not to get cute 
down there.  The marines in Guantanimo

               SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

And while we HEAR the letter read in V.O., what we're seeing 
is this: SANTIAGO's life in Guantanimo Bay over the last 8 
months. He had a rough time of it.

               THE SHOTS SHOULD INCLUDE:

-- SANTIAGO running along at the rear of a group of MARINES.  
It's been over seven miles and he's matted with sweat. A 
SERGEANT runs up along side, grabs his back, and pushes him 
to keep up with the group. SANTIAGO falls, struggles to get 
back up and keep running, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY

-- SANTIAGO doing push-ups alone in the rain. He's being 
supervised by a SERGEANT who sees to it that his face hits 
the mud every time down and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MESS HALL - DAY

-- SANTIAGO sitting alone in the mess hall, not a friend 
within four seats of him and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY

-- SANTIAGO being chewed out by a Lieutenant in front of his 
squad and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROCKY HILL - DAY

-- SANTIAGO running with the squad of MARINES again, this 
time down a rocky hill. It's hot as hell and it looks like 
he's gonna pass out.

He stumbles, and the SERGEANT picks him up and pushes him 
down the hill. He rolls about 30 feet before he stops. Over 
this, we HEAR

                                     SANTIAGO (V.O.)
                         "...My name is PFC William T. 
Santiago. I am a marine stationed at 
Marine Barracks, Rifle Security 
Company Windward, Second Platoon 
Delta. I am writing to inform you of 
my problems with my unit here in 
Cuba and to ask for your help. I've 
fallen out on runs before for several 
reasons such as feeling dizzy or 
nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen 
back about 20 or 30 yards going down 
a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant 
grabbed me and pushed me down the 
hill. Then I saw all black and the 
last thing I remember is hitting the 
deck. I was brought to the hospital 
where I was told I just had heat 
exhaustion and was explained to by 
the doctor that my body has trouble 
with the hot sun and I hyperventilate. 
I ask you to help me. Please sir. I 
just need to be transferred out of 
RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T. 
Santiago. U.S. Marine Corps."

At this point, with SANTIAGO's letter still in V.O., we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  JESSEP'S OFFICE - DAY

               THE LETTER - DAY

It's the last paragraph of the letter we've been hearing, 
and at the moment, we can't see the hands that are holding 
it.

                                     SANTIAGO (V.O.)
                         "P.S. In exchange for my transfer 
off the base, I'm willing to provide 
you with information about an illegal 
fenceline shooting that occurred the 
night of August 2nd."

And as these last words are spoken, we PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
COLONEL NATHAN R. JESSEP, who drops the letter he's been 
reading on his desk, where it joins a stack of other letters 
just like it.

JESSEP's a born leader, considered in many circles to be one 
of the real fair-haired boys of the Corps. He's smart as a 
whip with a sense of humor to match. As soon as he drops the 
letter, he says

                                     JESSEP
                         Who the fuck is PFC William T. 
Santiago.

He's talking to his two senior officers. CAPTAIN MARKINSON 
is in his late 40's. He's a career marine and a nice guy in 
a world where nice guys may not finish last, but they sure 
as shit don't finish first. Lt. JONATHAN JAMES KENDRICK is 
26, from Georgia, and an Academy graduate.

If you asked him he'd tell you that the gates to heaven are 
guarded by the U.S. Marine Corps.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Sir, Santiago is a member of Second 
Platoon, Delta.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yeah, well, apparently he's not very 
happy down here at Shangri-La, cause 
he's written letters to everyone but 
Santa Claus asking for a transfer. 
And now he's telling tales about a 
fenceline shooting.

He tosses the letter over to MARKINSON. MARKINSON is looking 
it over. JESSEP is waiting for a response.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
Matthew?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I'm appalled, sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         You're appalled? This kid broke the 
Chain of Command and he ratted on a 
man of his unit, to say nothing of 
the fact that he's a U.S. Marine and 
it would appear that he can't run 
from here to there without collapsing 
from heat exhaustion. What the fuck's 
going on over at Windward, Matthew?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Colonel, I think perhaps it would be 
better to hold this discussion in 
private.

                                     KENDRICK
                         That won't be necessary, Colonel, 
I'll handle the situation.

                                     MARKINSON
                         The same way you handled the Curtis 
Barnes incident? You're doing 
something wrong, Lieutenant this --

                                     KENDRICK
                         My methods of leadership are --

                                     MARKINSON
                         Don't interrupt me, I'm still your 
superior officer.

                                     JESSEP
                         And I'm yours, Matthew.

The room calms down for a moment.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
I want to know what we're gonna do 
about this.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I think Santiago should be transferred 
off the base. Right away.

                                     JESSEP
                         He's that bad, huh?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Not only that, but word of this 
letter's bound to get out. The kid's 
gonna get his ass kicked.

                                     JESSEP
                         Transfer Santiago. Yes I suppose 
you're right. I suppose that's the 
thing to do. Wait. Wait. I've got a 
better idea. Let's transfer the whole 
squad off the base. Let's -- on second 
thought -- Windward. The whole 
Windward division, let's transfer 
'em off the base. Jon, go on out 
there and get those boys down off 
the fence, they're packing their 
bags.
(calling out)
Tom!

The ORDERLY cones in from the outer office.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Sir!

                                     JESSEP
                         Got me the President on the phone, 
we're surrendering our position in 
Cuba.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Yes sir!

                                     JESSEP
                         Wait a minute, Tom.

The ORDERLY stops.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
Don't call the President just yet. 
Maybe we should consider this for a 
second. Maybe -- and I'm just spit 
balling here -- but maybe we as 
officers have a responsibility to 
train Santiago. Maybe we as officers 
have a responsibility to this country 
to see that the men and women charged 
with its security are trained 
professionals. Yes. I'm certain I 
once read that somewhere. And now 
I'm thinking that your suggestion of 
transferring Santiago, while 
expeditious, and certainly painless, 
might not be in a manner of speaking, 
the American way. Santiago stays 
where he is. We're gonna train the 
lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago 
doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness 
report, I'm gonna blame you. Then 
I'm gonna kill you.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes sir.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I think that's a mistake, Colonel.

                                     JESSEP
                         Matthew, I believe I will have that 
word in private with you now. Jon, 
that's all. Why don't you and I have 
lunch at the "O" club, we'll talk 
about the training of young William.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes sir, I'd be delighted to hear 
any suggestions you have.

                                     JESSEP
                         Dismissed.

KENDRICK is gone.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
Matthew, sit, please.

MARKINSON sits.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
What do you think of Kendrick?

                                     MARKINSON
                              (beat)
I don't know that --

                                     JESSEP
                         I think he's kind of a weasel, myself. 
But he's an awfully good officer, 
and in the end we see eye to eye on 
the best way to run a marine corps 
unit. We're in the business of saving 
lives, Matthew. That's a 
responsibility we have to take pretty 
seriously. And I believe that taking 
a marine who's not yet up to the job 
and packing him off to another 
assignment, puts lives in danger.

MARKINSON starts to stand --

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
Matthew, siddown.
(beat)
We go back a while. We went to the 
Academy together, we were commissioned 
together, we did our tours in Vietnam 
together. But I've been promoted up 
through the chain with greater speed 
and success than you have. Now if 
that's a source of tension or 
embarrassment for you, well, I don't 
give a shit. We're in the business 
of saving lives, Captain Markinson. 
Don't ever question my orders in 
front of another officer.

JESSEP grabs his hat and walks out, leaving MARKINSON sitting 
all alone, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - MAIN GATE - DAY

It's maybe a little hazier today than it was yesterday. An 
M.P. is waving a procession of three Military Police sedans 
and a fourth unmarked car through the gate. The cars drive 
through and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE BRIG - DAY

Another red-brick building. A few M.P.Is stand out front as 
the cars pull up. As soon as they come to a stop, all the 
doors swing open and various uniformed and non-uniformed 
officers hop out and move to the unmarked sedan where they 
escort DAWSON and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, out of the car.  
HAROLD DAWSON's a handsome, young, black corporal. Intense, 
controlled, and utterly professional.

LOUDEN DOWNEY's a 19-year-old kid off an Iowa farm. He's 
happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to do.

DAWSON's his hero.

The two prisoners stand still for a moment. They might as 
we'll be in Oz.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Hal?

DAWSON doesn't say anything.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (continuing)
Is this Washington, D.C.?

                                     M.P.
                         Alright, let's move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

and KAFFEE's at it again.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Alright, let's get tough out there!

JO walks up from behind the backstop.

                                     JO
                         Excuse me.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You want to suit up? We need all the 
help we can get.

                                     JO
                         No, thank you, I can't throw and 
catch things.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's okay, neither can they.

                                     JO
                         I wanted to talk to you about Corporal 
Dawson and Private Downey.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Say again?

                                     JO
                         Dawson and Downey.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
Those names sound like they should 
mean something to me, but I'm just 
not --

                                     JO
                         Dawson! Downey! Your clients!

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and 
Downey.
(beat)
Right.
(pause)
I've done something wrong again, 
haven't I?

                                     JO
                         I was wondering why two guys have 
been in a jail cell since this morning 
while their lawyer is outside hitting 
a ball.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We need the practice.

                                     JO
                         That wasn't funny.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It was a little funny.

                                     JO
                         Lieutenant, would you feel very 
insulted if I recommended to your 
supervisor that he assign different 
counsel?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why?

                                     JO
                         I don't think you're fit to handle 
this defense.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't even know me. Ordinarily 
it takes someone hours to discover 
I'm not fit to handle a defense.

Jo just stares.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
Oh come on, that was damn funny.

Jo moves close to KAFFEE to say this with a degree of 
confidentiality.

                                     JO
                         I do know you. Daniel AlliStair 
Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston 
Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel 
Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate 
and Attorney General, of the United 
States, died 1985. You went to Harvard 
Law on a Navy scholarship, probably 
because that's what your father wanted 
you to do, and now you're just 
treading water for the three years 
you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, 
just kinda layin' low til you can 
get out and get a real job. And if 
that's the situation, that's fine, I 
won't tell anyone. But my feeling is 
that if this case is handled in the 
same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian 
Bazaar manner with which you seem to 
handle everything else, something's 
gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be 
doing my job if I allowed Dawson and 
Downey to spend any more time in 
prison than absolutely necessary, 
because their attorney had pre-
determined the path of least 
resistance.

KAFFEE can't help but be impressed by that speech.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Wow.
(beat)
I'm sexually aroused, Commander.

                                     JO
                         I don't think your clients murdered 
anybody.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you basing this on?

                                     JO
                         There was no intent.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The doctor's report says that Santiago 
died of asphyxiation brought on by 
acute lactic acidosis, and that the 
nature of the acidosis strongly 
suggests poisoning.
(beat)
Now, I don't know what any of that 
means, but it sounds pretty bad.

                                     JO
                         Santiago died at one a.m. At three 
the doctor was unable to determine 
the cause of death, but two hours 
later he said it was poison.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Oh, now I see what you're saying.  
It had to be Professor Plum in the 
library with the candlestick.

                                     JO
                         I'm gonna speak to your supervisor.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania 
Avenue. It's a big white house with 
pillars in front.

                                     JO
                         Thank you.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I don't think you'll have much luck, 
though. I was assigned by Division, 
remember? Somebody over there thinks 
I'm a good lawyer. So while I 
appreciate your interest and admire 
your enthusiasm, I think I can pretty 
much handle things myself.

                                     JO
                         Do you know what a code red is?

KAFFEE doesn't, but he doesn't say anything.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
What a pity.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BRIG - DAY

And an M.P. is leading KAFFEE and SAM down to DAWSON and 
DOWNEY's cell.

                                     M.P.
                         Officer on deck, ten-hut.

DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention. Through the following, 
the M.P. will unlock the call door and let the lawyers in.

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson, 
sir. Rifle Security Company Windward, 
Second Platoon, Delta.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Someone hasn't been working and 
playing well with others, Harold.

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, yes sir!

                                     DOWNEY
                         Sir, PFC Louden Downey.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm Daniel Kaffee, this is Sam 
Weinerg, you can sitdown.

DAWSON and DOWNEY aren't too comfortable sitting in the 
presence of officers, but they do as they're told. KAFFEE's 
pulled out some documents, SAM's sitting on one of the cots 
taking notes.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; to DAWSON)
Is this your signature?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't have to call me sir.
(to DOWNEY)
Is this your signature?

                                     DOWNEY
                         Sir, yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And you certainly don't have to do 
it twice in one sentence. Harold, 
what's a Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, a Code Red is a disciplinary 
engagement.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What does that mean, exactly?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, a marine falls out of line, 
it's up to the men in his unit to 
get him back on track.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's a garden variety Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold, you say sir and I turn around 
and look for my father. Danny, Daniel, 
Kaffee. Garden variety; typical. 
What's a basic Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, a marine has refused to bathe 
on a regular basis. The men in his 
squad would give him a G.I. shower.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's that?

                                     DAWSON
                         Scrub brushes, brillo pads, steel 
wool...

                                     SAM
                         Beautiful.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Was the attack on Santiago a Code 
Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to DOWNEY)
Do you ever talk?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, Private Downey will answer any 
direct questions you ask him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Swell. Private Downey, the rag you 
stuffed in Santiago's mouth, was 
there poison on it?

                                     DOWNEY
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Silver polish, turpentine, anti-
freeze...

                                     DOWNEY
                         No sir. We were gonna shave his head, 
sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         When all of a sudden...?

                                     DOWNEY
                         We saw blood drippinq out of his 
mouth. Then we pulled the tape off, 
and there was blood all down his 
face, sir. That's when Corporal Dawson 
called the ambulance.

KAFFEE tries not to make too big a deal out of this last 
piece of news.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to DAWSON)
Did anyone see you call the ambulance?

                                     DAWSON
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Were you there when the ambulance 
got there?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir, that's when we were taken 
under arrest.

KAFFEE kinda strolls to the corner of the cell to think for 
a moment.

                                     SAM
                              (to DAWSON)
On the night of August 2nd, did you 
fire a shot across the fenceline 
into Cuba?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir.

                                     SAM
                         Why?

                                     DAWSON
                         My mirror engaged, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to SAM)
His mirror engaged?

                                     SAM
                         For each American sentry post there's 
a Cuban counterpart. They're called 
mirrors. The corporal's claiming 
that his mirror was about to fire at 
him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago's letter to the NIS said 
you fired illegally. He's saying 
that the guy, the mirror, he never 
made a move.

DAWSON says nothing.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
Oh, Harold?

SAM is staring at DAWSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
You see what I'm getting at? If 
Santiago didn't have anything on 
you, then why did you give him a 
Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Because he broke the chain of command, 
sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         He what?

                                     DAWSON
                         He went outside his unit, sir. If he 
had a problem, he should've spoken 
to me, sir. Then his Sergeant, then 
Company Commander, then --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah, yeah, alright. Harold, did you 
assault Santiago with the intent of 
killing him?

                                     DAWSON
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What was your intent?

                                     DAWSON
                         To train him, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Train him to do what?

                                     DAWSON
                         Train him to think of his unit before 
himself. To respect the code.

                                     SAM
                         What's the code?

                                     DAWSON
                         Unit Corps God Country.

                                     SAM
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     DAWSON
                         Unit Corps God Country, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Goverrment of the United States 
wants to charge you two with murder. 
You want me to go to the prosecutor 
with unit, corps, god, country?

DAWSON stares at KAFFEE.

                                     DAWSON
                         That's our code, sir.

KAFFEE takes a long moment. He picks up his briefcase and he 
and SAM move to the door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We'll be back. You guys need anything? 
Books paper, cigarettes, a ham 
sandwich?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir. No thank you. Sir.

KAFFEE smiles at DAWSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold, I think there's a concept 
you better start warming up to.

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm the only friend you've got.

And as KAFFEE and SAM walk out the open cell door, DAWSON 
and DOWNEY come to attention and snap a salute.

They hold the salute until KAFFEE and SAM are well out of 
sight, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  KAFFEE'S OFFICE - DAY

He's packing up stuff into his briefcase at the end of the 
work day. Lt. JACK ROSS, a marine lawyer maybe two years 
older than Kaffee, opens the door and walks in..

                                     ROSS
                         Dan Kaffee.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sailin' Jack Ross.

                                     ROSS
                         Welcome to the big time.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You think so?

                                     ROSS
                         I hope for Dawson and Downey's sake 
you practice law better than you 
play softball.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, 
I don't do anything better than I 
play softball. What are we lookin' 
at?

                                     ROSS
                         They plead guilty to manslaughter, 
I'll drop the conspiracy and the 
conduct unbecoming. 20 years, they'll 
be home in half that time.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I want twelve.

                                     ROSS
                         Can't do it.

                                     KAFFEE
                         They called the ambulance, Jack.

                                     ROSS
                         I don't care if they called the Avon 
Lady, they killed a marine.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The rag was tested for poison.  The 
autopsy, lab report, even the initial 
E.R. and C.O.D. reports. They all 
say the same thing: Maybe, maybe 
not.

                                     ROSS
                         The Chief of Internal Medicine at 
the Guantanamo Bay Naval hospital 
says he's sure.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do you know about Code Reds?

ROSS smiles and shakes his head.

                                     ROSS
                         Oh man.

He closes the office door.

                                     ROSS
                              (continuing)
Are we off the record?

                                     KAFFEE
                         You tell me.

                                     ROSS
                              (pause)
I'm gonna give you the twelve years, 
but before you go getting yourself 
into trouble tomorrow, you should 
know this: The platoon commander Lt. 
Jonathan Kendrick, had a meeting 
with the men. And he specifically 
told them not to touch Santiago.

KAFFEE holds for a moment. Dawson and Downey neglected to 
mention this... He packs up his briefcase and cleats.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll talk to you when I get back.

                                     ROSS
                         Hey, we got a little four-on-four 
going tomorrow night. When does your 
plane get in?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  THE PARKING LOT - DUSK

It's dusk and people on the base are going home from work.  
We can see the flag being lowered in the background.

KAFFEE's walking toward his car. JO intercepts him and starts 
walking along with him.

                                     JO
                         Hi there.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any luck getting me replaced?

                                     JO
                         Is there anyone in this command that 
you don't either drink or play 
softball with?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander --

                                     JO
                         Listen, I came to make peace. We 
started off on the wrong foot. What 
do you say? Friends?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Look, I don't --

                                     JO
                         By the way, I brought Downey some 
comic books he was asking for. The 
kid, Kaffee, I swear, he doesn't 
know where he is, he doesn't even 
know why he's been arrested.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander --

                                     JO
                         You can call me Joanne.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Joanne --

                                     JO
                         or Jo.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo?

                                     JO
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, if you ever speak to a client of 
mine again without my permission, 
I'll have you disbarred. Friends?

                                     JO
                         I had authorization.

                                     KAFFEE
                         From where?

                                     JO
                         Downey's closest living relative, 
Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's 
side.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You got authorization from Aunt Ginny?

                                     JO
                         I gave her a call like you asked. 
Very nice woman, we talked for about 
an hour.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You got authorization from Aunt Ginny.

                                     JO
                         Perfectly within my province.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Does Aunt Ginny have a barn? We can 
hold the trial there. I can sew the 
costumes, and maybe his Uncle Goober 
can be the judge.

Jo steps aside and lets KAFFEE got into his car.

                                     JO
                         I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And the hits just keep on comin'.

HOLD on KAFFEE and Jo. JO smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK NEWSSTAND - DUSK

               KAFFEE IN HIS CAR

He's driving down a Washington street and pulls over at a 
sidewalk newsstand.

He gets out of his car, leaving the lights flashing, and 
runs up to the newsstand.

As he plunks his 35 cents down and picks up a newspaper, he 
engages in his daily ritual with LUTHER, the newsstand 
operator.

                                     KAFFEE
                         How's it goin', Luther?

                                     LUTHER
                         Another day, another dollar, captain.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You gotta play 'em as they lay, 
Luther.

                                     LUTHER
                         What comes around, goes around, you 
know what I'm sayin'.

                                     KAFFEE
                         If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

                                     LUTHER
                         Hey, if you've got your health, you 
got everything.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Love makes the world go round. I'll 
see you tomorrow, Luther.

And we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A baby sleeping in a crib pull rack to reveal SAM is standing 
over the crib. KAFFEE's sitting on a beer.

                                     SAM
                         When Nancy gets back, you're my 
witness. The baby spoke. My daughter 
said a word.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Your daughter made a sound, Sam, I'm 
not sure it was a word.

                                     SAM
                         Oh come on, it was a word.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Okay.

                                     SAM
                         You heard her. The girl sat here, 
pointed, and said "Pa". She did. She 
said "Pa".

                                     KAFFEE
                         She was pointing at a doorknob.

                                     SAM
                         That's right. Pointing, as if to 
say, "Pa, look, a doorknob".

SAM joins KAFFEE in the living room.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jack Ross came to see me today. He 
offered me twelve years.

                                     SAM
                         That's what you wanted.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I know, and I'll... I guess, I mean --
(beat)
I'll take it.

                                     SAM
                         So?

                                     KAFFEE
                         It took albout 45 seconds. He barely 
put up a fight.

                                     SAM
                              (beat)
Danny, take the twelve years, it's a 
gift.

KAFFEE finishes off his beer, and stands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't believe their story, do 
you? You think they ought to go to 
jail for the rest of their lives.

                                     SAM
                         I believe every word they said. And 
I think they ought to go to jail for 
the rest of their lives.

KAFFEE nods and puts down the empty beer bottle.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll see you tomorrow.

Sam opens the front door for him and they stand out on the 
stoop for a moment.

                                     SAM
                         Remember to wear your whites, it's 
hot down there.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I don't like the whites.

                                     SAM
                         Nobody likes the whites, but we're 
going to Cuba in August. You got 
Dramamine?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dramamine keeps you cool?

                                     SAM
                         Dramamine keeps you from throwing 
up, you get sick when you fly.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I get sick when I fly because I'm 
afraid of crashing into a large 
mountain, I don't think Dramamine'll 
help.

                                     SAM
                         I've got some oregano, I hear that 
works pretty good.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah, right.

KAFFEE starts toward his car, then turns around.

                                     KAFFEE
