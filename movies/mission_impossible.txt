MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE




                       FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT


                         16TH AUGUST 1995






     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS






     INT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT

We're in a large closet.  JACK KIEFER, an athletic American
in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a
corner, staring at a television screen.

The television shows a surveillance view of the living room
that lies outside the confines of the closet.  The TV image
is in black and white.  JACK shifts, trying like hell to get
comfortable but he's been there a while

     ON THE SCREEN

A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel
room.  Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits
in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T-
shirt.  There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the
room behind him.  A legend:

                          KIEV

KASIMOV is sobbing.  Uncontrollably.  A MAN enters the room,
ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian
godfather.  The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out.  ANATOLY
looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit
by him in a chair he picks up for him.  KASIMOV does as he is
bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY.  They speak in Russian
which is subtitled.

                          ANATOLY
                Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called
us.

                          KASIMOV
                     (sobbing)
I don't remember what happened!  We were
at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having
fun.

ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the
room.  A WOMAN lies half under the sheets.  She's lying in an
unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared
with blood.  She's dead.  ANATOLY lifts her eyelid.

                          KASIMOV
                I don't even know how I got here.
I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I
didn't lay a finger on her.

ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN.

                          ANATOLY
                Kasimov.  Don't flounder.

     IN THE CLOSET

JACK, impatient, checks his watch. 

                          JACK 
                Jesus, she's been under too long.  Come 
on, come on! 

     ON THE SCREEN 

                          KASIMOV 
                You're the only one who can help me. 

Desperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket.  But ANATOLY hits 
his hand away and smacks him around the head. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

JACK reacts. 

     ON THE SCREEN

ANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV. 

                          ANATOLY 
                C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. 

                          KASIMOV 
                They'll kill me. 

ANATOLY paces up the room, away from KASIMOV. 

                          ANATOLY 
                You asked for my help.  You 
help...come on... 

                          KASIMOV
                You're right, of course. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

JACK leans forward. 

                          JACK 
                The name pal...give us the name. 

     ON THE SCREEN 

                          KASIMOV 
                The contact in Minsk..the contact in 
Minsk..works in a travel agency. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

                          JACK 
                Come on! 

     ON THE SCREEN 

                          ANATOLY 
                Come on! 

                          KASIMOV 
                His name is.....Dimitri Miediev. 

                          ANATOLY 
                Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev... 

     IN THE CLOSET 

                          JACK 
                Got him. 

     ON THE SCREEN 

Back on screen, ANATOLY places a hand on KASIMOV'S shoulder
as if he had just anointed him. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

In the closet, JACK types the name into a computer and cross 
checks -- "MIEDIEV" comes up, then "posting/American 
consulate/Kiev." 

JACK turns and nods to a WHOREHOUSE WAITRESS in costume in 
the closet next to him, dressed in traditional Russian tunic 
and virtually no bottom.  She quickly leaves. 

     INT. SHABBY ROOM - NIGHT

We enter the room for the first time as the WAITRESS does. 
She's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot 
glasses. 

                          ANATOLY 
                Now, we drink. 

He pours them out and hands one to KASIMOV. 

                          ANATOLY (CONT'D) 
                To friends. 

                          KASIMOV 
                Yes, Anatoly, yes. 

                          JACK 
                Cheers. 

He drinks.  He blinks.  Something felt funny about that. 
Dizzied, KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor. ANATOLY 
moves to the closet door and opens it. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

ANATOLY reaches up to his face --

--and tears away a mask of flesh.  He's no middle aged 
Russian mobster, he's ETHAN HUNT, an American in his early 
thirties.  He gestures to KASIMOV contemptuously.  JACK hands 
ETHAN a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the 
room. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (in English now) 
Get rid of this scum. 

Immediately, there is activity, and PEOPLE everywhere.  TWO 
OTHERS come into the room and carry KASIMOV out. 

ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. He cheeks 
the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. He 
strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the 
dead woman's thigh.  He checks her pulse again, checking a 
stopwatch.  In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open. 

CLAIRE is her name, a French woman of thirty or so. She half 
rolls over, GROANS, and wipes some of the blood from her 
mouth. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Did we get it? 

                          ETHAN 
                We got it.  On your feet. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here. 

                          ETHAN 
                Walk, just walk.  Start walking. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I'm walking. 

                          ETHAN 
                Talking's good, walking's better. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Sleeping's better. 

Meanwhile, MEN in overalls take apart the room.  The ceiling 
lifts right off the walls, and the walls themselves start to 
come down, revealing the "hotel room" to be an elaborate set 
in the middle of an empty warehouse. 

JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE 
her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN 
stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him 
questioningly. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Are 
with you? 

                          ETHAN 
                If you're gonna do this again Claire, 
It's not gonna be on my watch. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Oh yeah? 

JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE 
her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN 
stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him, 
questioningly. 

                          JACK 
                Claire. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jack. 

She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her 
finger.  ETHAN notices.  He turns and SHOUTS to the room at 
large. 

                          ETHAN



                          JACK 
                Just waiting for you, tubs. 

He walks across the room and out the door.  CLAIRE, worried, 
clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding 
ring. 

We move in on it --

                                                            CUT TO: 

     INT. JET - DAY

-- and come out on another wedding ring, this one on a MAN's 
finger. One of several he's drumming on an arm rest in the 
plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner.  He shoves 
some money into his wallet, and as he does so we catch a 
fleeting glimpse of a photograph of CLAIRE. 

The pilot's voice makes an announcement. 

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off 
at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight 
thousand feet-and we should be arriving 
in Prague right on schedule. 

A FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes her way between the seats, passing 
out menus. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? 

A passenger takes one.  The ATTENDANT continues on. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 

                Would you like to watch a movie Mr 
Phelps? 

The MAN with the wedding ring looks up.  JIM PHELPS is in his 
mid-forties, good-looking, intense.  He's a tired man, and 
not just now, it's a profound fatigue.  He looks up at the 
ATTENDANT and smiles warmly. 

                          PHELPS 
                No, I prefer the theatre.  

A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes 
stilted. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Would you consider the cinema of the
Ukraine? 

                          PHELPS 
                Perhaps you'd choose one for me. 

The ATTENDANT turns and walks away.  PHELPS sits back, shakes 
a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the 
armrest. 

     AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN.

The FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8 
cassettes of feature films.  She opens a panel in the top of 
the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there. 

     BACK AT PHELPS' SEAT

The ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS. 
He takes it without a word and she moves on. 

PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between 
his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small 
movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the 
other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the 
armrest, and puts the tape in. 

He presses play.

     ON THE TAPE, 

the image of a man comes on.  EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, 
but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed 
glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than 
tieless.  But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever 
look away.  He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (on the tape) 
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're 
about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- 

The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man 
in his forties.  The image is herky-jerky videotape, 
presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks 
down a foreign street. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                -- a former KGB Line X officer now 
working the international black market 
selling intelligence.  This morning, we 
learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half 
of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- 
official cover agents working in Eastern 
Europe. 

The screen shows an image of what such a list might look 
like, code names and other information scrolling by on a 
computer screen at high speed. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                For security reasons, the NOC list is 
divided into two encoded halves. 
Golitsyn already has the cryptonym 
portion, which contains agent code names 
and targeting areas.  This portion is 
useless unless combined with the second 
half -- the true name list that is kept 
in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. 

The Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building 
at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava 
River. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the 
true name list at an Embassy function 
tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you 
decide to accept it, is to obtain 
photographic proof of the theft, apprehend 
those involved, and return the stolen 
list.  I don't have to stress the 
importance of this matter, Jim.  We're 
keeping it internally black. Because of  
its urgency, I've already sent to Prague 
a team selected from your usual group. 

Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already 
seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                Ethan Hunt will of course be your point 
man, as usual.  He's in Kiev; we're 
getting word to him now. 

     INT. JET - DAY

PHELPS sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his 
tired brow.  KITTRIDGE himself comes back on the tape. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                As always, should you or any member of 
your IM force be caught or killed, the 
Secretary will disavow all knowledge of 
your actions.  This tape will self- 
destruct in five seconds.  Good luck, 
Jim! 

PHELPS inhales deeply -- 

-- the tape in the armrest starts to smolder, sending up a 
plume of wispy smoke -- 

-- and PHELPS exhales, concealing the plume in a cloud of 
cigarette smoke. 

                                                            CUT TO: 

     EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - DAY

SARAH and HANNA, a German woman in her mid-thirties enter. 
Another legend: 

                         PRAGUE 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - PRAGUE - DAY 

The IMF team's safe house is a sparsely furnished Prague 
apartment with a panoramic view of the city. 

The IMF team is scattered around the room. Sketches, pads, 
overfilled ashtrays and equipment are strewn everywhere. 
JACK and SARAH seated next to each other - JACK demonstrating 
the VISCO glasses to her.  CLAIRE is seated opposite JACK at 
the computer.  JIM and ETHAN are in the kitchen.  HANNAH 
taking a roll of black-out curtain through the room. 

                          JACK 
                Look to your right, then back to me. 
There's a camera built right into the 
bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and 
transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?

                          SARAH 
                Of course I can hear you. 

                          JACK 
                No, in your...ear piece. You have a 
lovely smile (eyes). Can you hear me 
now? 

                          SARAH 
                Loud and clear. 

                          JACK 
                What's going on? 

                          SARAH 
                I don't know. 

                          JACK 
                Why don't you take a look? 

                          SARAH 
                Jack...that's spying. 

                          JACK 
                That's what we do isn't it? 

                          SARAH 
                Jack you're so wicked. 

                          JACK 
                Too wicked to have a drink later? 

                          SARAH 
                I think I might just take that look. 

ETHAN and JIM PHELPS are in a heated conversation. 

                          ETHAN 
                Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more 
than ninety days leave coming. 

                          PHELPS 
                A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. 
Take it all, if you want.  After this one. 

                          ETHAN 
                I thought I'd take some now. 

                          PHELPS
                     (quietly, to Ethan) 
What the hell's made you decide to take 
your leave at the worst possible time? 
Claire's in a weird mood too. 

                          ETHAN 
                Oh?  What's the problem? 

                          PHELPS 
                I don't know, I had to go to Chicago 
again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me. 

                          ETHAN 
                Tell you what? 

                          PHELPS 
                When you started noticing your short term 
memory loss.  What the problem was you 
and Claire had in Kiev? 

                          ETHAN 
                What problem? 

                          PHELPS
                     (laughs)
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking
burnout here?

                          ETHAN 
                I guess. 

                          PHELPS 
                Ethan, you 

                          ETHAN
                Why not? 

                          PHELPS 
                Because I can't afford it. And because 
you'd burn up before you'd burn out. 

CLAIRE, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to 
be the reference point in the following exchange: 

                          ETHAN 
                How was Chicago? 

                          PHELPS 
                Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto 
dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the 
one about the astronaut who comes back 
from the first manned flight to Mars 
after two years?  His wife's got a year 
old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was 
it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh,
it was my friend Sammy."  She says it 
wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my 
friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, 
don't you think I have any friends of my 
own?!" 

PHELPS laughs.  ETHAN doesn't.  The back of CLAIRE'S head is 
in his line of sight. 

                          PHELPS (CONT'D) 
                Boy, you really are grim. Come here, 
take a look. 

He leads ETHAN to the window, which overlooks the city. 

     EXT. PRAGUE - DAY 

ETHAN's POV of Embassy. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

ETHAN nods. 

                          PHELPS (CONT'D) 
                Beyond Charles Bridge there is our 
Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if 
anything goes wrong, this guy will steal 
the names of our agents in every country 
all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to 
the highest bidders -- third world 
terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- 
any and everybody who'd love to get rid 
of long term coverts like us, and some 
very dear friends among them.  If they're 
exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over 
here.  Take a lock at this. 

CLAIRE, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a 
quicktime video image in a box on her screen.  In it, an old 
edition of the McLaughlin Report, the PBS news show, is 
playing. 

ETHAN is distracted by it. 

     INSERT - TELEVISION

SENATOR WALTZER, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, 
is holding forth: 

                          SENATOR WALTZER 
                I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA 
and all its shadow organizations have 
become irrelevant at best and 
unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we 
throw a little light on the whole concept 
of the Pentagon's "black budget."  These 
covert agency subgroups have confidential 
funding, they report to no one -- who are
these people?!  We were living in a 
democracy the last time I checked. 

     BACK TO SCENE 

ETHAN looks back at JIM. 

                          ETHAN 
                You're going to use Walter? 

                          PHELPS 
                He's our guy. 

                          ETHAN 
                Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? 

                          PHELPS 
                Not this week. This week he's flyfishing 
at the Oughterard Slough in County 
Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. 

                          ETHAN
                He won't be back in a hurry? 

                          PHELPS 
                No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? 
You think the plot'll work? 

                          ETHAN 
                Sure.  If the main character does. 

                          PHELPS 
                If you were me, Ethan, who would 
trust to make him believable? 

JACK comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum.

                          JACK 
                Sorry, am I interrupting?  

                          ETHAN
                Always. 

JACK shows the gum to ETHAN.

                          JACK 
                Stick of gum. If you come up against a 
lock you can't pick -- 

Half the gum is red, the other half is green. 

                          JACK (CONT'D) 
                Red light.  Green light.  Mash them 
together, asta lasagna.  Don't get any on 
you -- you have five seconds. 

He offers the gum to ETHAN.

                          PHELPS 
                Are you gonna take it? 

CLAIRE glances up from the computer and catches ETHAN's eye. 
PHELPS may have caught the glance, but is focused on ETHAN. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (relenting) 
Give me the God damn gum. 

                          JACK 
                Just don't chew it. 

                          PHELPS 
                Thank you. 

                                                            CUT TO: 

     EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

The American Embassy glitters beside the Vltava River.  Party 
at the Embassy tonight. 

     INT. AN ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

JACK, wearing black coveralls and slightly odd-looking 
eyeglasses (they're called Visco glasses), enters an elevator 
shaft through a small door at the base of the wall.  He looks 
up the shaft, shining a flashlight until he finds what he's 
looking for -- 

-- a gray metal box, protruding from the wall one floor up. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

PHELPS is at a table in the safe house apartment, watching 
the bank of monitors HANNAH wired together earlier. The 
monitors are alive now, showing various views of the inside 
of the Embassy, where the party is going on, and one view of 
the elevator shaft. 

PHELPS wearing an IMF headset and speaks into the mouthpiece. 

                          PHELPS 
                Ethan.  Jack's inside.  Window's open by 
twenty-three hundred. 

     INT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

Inside the Embassy, the party is a formal, tuxedoed affair 
that's in full swing on the second floor. 

SENATOR WALTZER, the man who was on TV, walks up a grand 
staircase, headed in.  An AMERICAN DIPLOMAT in a tuxedo 
hurries up to him. 

                          DIPLOMAT 
                How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, 
the Ambassador's aide.  If I could just 
steer you through the reception line here
                --

The DIPLOMAT pilots the SENATOR by one arm, guiding him to a 
reception line at the base of the stairs to the party. 

                          DIPLOMAT (CONT'D) 
                Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the 
director of the National Gallery -- Petr 
Brandl, the mayor of Prague -- 

SARAH, a very attractive young American dressed in an elegant 
gown, steps out of the reception line and shakes hands with 
     WALTZER. 

                          SARAH 
                I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator? 

                          SENATOR WALTZER 
                Of course I do.  How are you, Miss 
Norman? 

He leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so 
SARAH whispers something in his ear. 

                          SARAH 
                He's in pocket.  Under the archway behind me. 

Her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team. 

The SENATOR pulls a pair of Visco glasses from his pocket 
(and if we didn't know the SENATOR was ETHAN before, this 
confirms it), puts them on, and looks up, over her shoulder. 

     UNDER AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE ENTRANCE, 

ALEKSANDER GOLITSYN, the Ukrainian, has just come in from 
outside. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

PHELPS sees the SENATOR's point of view of GOLITSYN, through 
the glasses, broadcast back to PHELPS' monitor.  He speaks 
into his microphone. 

                          PHELPS 
                Sarah, mark the package and go to two. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

SARAH still has the SENATOR's attention. 

                          SARAH 
                Your advance team mentioned you'd want a 
tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead 
and set that up for you -- 

                          SENATOR WALTZER 
                Terrific.  Let's get going. 
(to the Diplomat) 
Will you excuse us?  

He slips an arm around SARAH and they walk off, not into the 
party, but the other way, toward a staircase that leads 
further into the Embassy. 

                          DIPLOMAT 
                Uh, sir? 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT                               

JACK climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal 
box.  He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a 
noise from above.  He looks up and sees the elevator above 
him descending. 

JACK quickly pulls himself flush against the wall. The 
elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him 
to the wall. 

                          JACK 
                Great.  Come on. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT 

As the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN, 
SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse.  But as 
she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing 
herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYN'S head.  He never 
notices.  They move on and down the flight of stairs. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT     

JIM PHELPS monitors the Visco views of the party.  He looks 
to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party, a jumpy 
one, as someone hurrying up stairs. 

                          PHELPS 
                Hannah.  He's marked.  Lets go. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

On a flight of stairs, HANNAH, dressed for the party and 
slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs. 

                          HANNAH 
                En route. 

She also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the 
party below.  She pushes a micro switch on the side of her 
glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the 
lenses. 

                          PHELPS (O/S) 
                Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to
night vision). 

     HANNAHS VISCO POV 

the party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands 
out.  That head is GOLITSYN'S, his hair a fluorescent green 
where SARAH sprayed it. 

     INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

The SENATOR (let's just call him ETHAN) and SARAH come down 
the stairs and pass a sign that says "Denied Area -- 
Political Attaches Only."  ETHAN checks his watch.  23:00. 

He nods to SARAH, they round a corner, and come to an 
elevator at the end of the corridor.  A sign in front of it 
says "Out of Order."  They head for it anyway. 

A MARINE GUARD appears from behind a side door, catching them 
by surprise.  

                          JACK 
                Governor's in position.  We have the elevator. 

                          GUARD 
                Excuse me, can I help you? 

                          SARAH 
                -- which leads directly to the Denied 
Area, the only limited access area in the 
whole facility. 

SARAH flashes an ID at the GUARD and keeps talking. 

                          SARAH (CONT'D) 
                As you can see. this area has both a 
Marine guard and video surveillance, and 
is strictly monitored at all times. 

She walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank 
and slides her thumb inside.  The panel lights up and flashes 
a message -- "ACCESS DENIED."  SARAH and ETHAN trade a look. 

                          SARAH (CONT'D)
                     (covering) 
Senator, don't you have a young man on 
your staff named JACK? 

She tries the thumb again, Still no soap. 

                          ETHAN 

named Jack.  Not a reliable man, as I 
recall.  Constantly late or behind in his 
work. 

Now the GUARD, noticing that Sarah's not being allowed 
access, comes closer to them. 

                          GUARD 
                Excuse me, let me see that ID again! 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

JACK is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening 
to their conversation. 

                          PHELPS (O.S.) 
                Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a 
second.  Keep dancing.  

                          ETHAN (O.S.) 
                     (with the Senator's southern accent) 
We were forced to tie him to my best 
stallion and drag him around the barn a 
few times.  

Finally, the elevator moves down a floor and JACK is freed. 

                          JACK 
                Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on
it. 

He quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of 
circuitry.  He patches in his computer, climbs on top of the 
elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download.

     THE LAPTOP

there's a split-screen of SARAH's thumbprint and the ID 
picture.  JACK downloads her file into the security computer. 

     INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

Ignoring the GUARD, SARAH turns and slides her thumb into the 
thumbprint analyzer once more.  The panel glows, this time 
the message flashes -- 

                          IDENTITY CONFIRMED 

-- and the elevator doors slide open briskly.  

The GUARD, surprised, now catches sight of the SENATOR. 

                          GUARD 
                Oh. Sorry, sir. 

He snaps a salute.  ETHAN and SARAH get into the elevator and 
the doors close behind them. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

JACK looks down at the elevator below.  Through a grating, he 
can see them inside. 

                          JACK 
                The drink (date) with Sarah is definitely
off. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

PHELPS moves from JACK's view of the elevator car to HANNAH's 
view of the party on his video monitors. 

                          PHELPS 
                     (a touch of impatience) 
Hannah -- I'm blind again.  Hannah. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

HANNAH, stationed on the second floor of the Embassy, moves 
to get a better view of the party. She reacquires GOLITSYN's 
glowing head.  

                          HANNAH 
                He's heading to the denied area. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

This work room is filled with combination lock filing 
cabinets and various computer terminals.  ETHAN hands SARAH 
his Visco glasses and she crosses the room, placing them 
upside down on top of a filing cabinet.  

ETHAN straps on a Visco wrist monitor and tunes it in, 
switching several times. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (to Sarah) 
Higher.  Higher.  

                          SARAH 
                Higher. 

                          ETHAN 
                Right, right.  Good. 

SARAH adjusts the glasses. 

     THROUGH THE GLASSES, 

the view of the main computer terminal is upside down, but 
clear.  Anyone sitting there will be recorded. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

On PHELPS' monitor, we see ETHAN, via his Visco glasses on 
the filing cabinet, standing next to the computer.  PHELPS 
barks out a warning.  

                          PHELPS 
                Get moving, Ethan.  He's rolling to you. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

ETHAN pushes the elevator button but the elevator is already 
moving up. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jack we're in position. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT/WORK ROOM - NIGHT

In a split view, we see both sides of the elevator wall 
simultaneously -- on one side, JACK is lying on top of the 
rising elevator, on the other side, ETHAN and SARAH are 
waiting for it to arrive. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jack.  Jack. 

                          JACK 
                I didn't touch it. 

The elevator stops, the doors open -- 

-- and GOLITSYN gets on.  GOLITSYN descends in the elevator 
with JACK on top and ETHAN and SARAH waiting down below! 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

PHELPS sees JACK's point of view of the elevator, with 
GOLITSYN inside.  

                          PHELPS 
                     (tension rising) 
He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box! 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

ETHAN and SARAH are waiting in front of the elevator, the one 
GOLITSYN is about to step off of!  ETHAN looks around, for a 
place to hide. 

                          ETHAN 
                OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open
the doors. 

                          SARAH 
                What about my coat?  I'll freeze. 

                          JACK (O.S.) 
                I don't have it. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 

PHELPS whips over to a laptop and starts typing. 

                          PHELPS 
                Opening the doors.  Go under. 

He jabs ENTER on his keyboard. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

The elevator doors WHISK open, revealing the empty shaft 
beyond.  ETHAN and SARAH jump into the shaft. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

ETHAN and SARAH jump down into the five foot empty space 
below the work room floor.  Above them, the elevator 
continues its descent, with them hiding below.  The elevator 
drops to just over their heads and stops. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

GOLITSYN steps off the elevator, crosses the room and slides 
a 3.5 computer disk into the computer in the work room. 
Through the Visco glasses, we can clearly see him at work, 
downloading the vital information. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

Waiting below the elevator, ETHAN takes off his jacket, 
starting to reverse it.  He checks his Visco wrist monitor as 
GOLITSYN perpetrates the theft.  He smiles and speaks into a 
microphone.  

                          ETHAN 
                He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack. 

                          JACK (O.S.) 
                Give me a break, Pops. 

                          SARAH 
                Such a nice ass. 

                          JACK (O.S.) 
                And a lonely ass. 

                          ETHAN 
                Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport 
in five minutes. 

                          CLAIRE (O.S.) 
                Roger that. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

Back inside, ETHAN strips off his mask and wearing his now 
reversed jacket, he and SARAH exit the small door at the base 
of the elevator shaft. 

     EXT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

JACK rapidly disconnects his equipment.  But as he pulls the 
final electrical clip from the elevator's wiring, it flashes 
and SPARKS. 

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

ETHAN and SARAH exit an Embassy service area by the 
waterfront and blend into the Embassy crowd, as an amorous 
couple. 

                          ETHAN
                In position.  Jack open the door, let the
package roll.

                          JACK (O.S.)
                Roger that.  Opening doors now.

                          ETHAN
                Stairway, youre wrapped, go to
transport.

ETHANS voice comes over HANNAHS earpiece.

                          HANNAH
                En route.

HANNAH breaks off and goes up the stairs.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

The button marked "ROOF" lights up, seemingly all by itself.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

The car engages with a sharp jolt --

                          JACK
                Hey.

--and starts to rise.  JACK looks down, into the elevator
car, through the grate.  Theres no one in it.

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

On one of his monitors, PHELPS sees the elevator moving in
the shaft.

                          PHELPS
                Jack, what are you doing?!

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

                          JACK
                Im not doing anything!  (I dont have it
either).

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

PHELPS is typing at his keyboard and jamming the enter button
but gets no response.

                          PHELPS
                I dont have it -- 
control!

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

JACKS face pales.  He looks up, above him, at the
approaching ceiling.

                          JACK
                Uh -- then I have a problem.

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

GOLITSYN pulls out the now-programmed disk from the computer,
slips it in his jacket pocket and heads for the door.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

JACK looks up through his Visco glasses at the approaching
roof, covered with spikes.

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

Through the monitor, ETHAN sees JACKS P.O.V. of the roof of
the building approaching.  Fast.

                          ETHAN
                Cut the power.  Cut the power Jack.  Do
you hear me.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

On top of the elevator, JACK has ripped open the control
panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get
the thing to stop.

He swears, his fingers fumble, he works faster and faster.
He looks up.  The roof of the building is nearly upon him.


                Come on, Jack, come on.

JACK looks up again, he cringes, he covers his head with his
hands, he SCREAMS --

--and hes crushed to death against the roof.

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

ETHAN is staring at the static on the monitor that once was
JACKS signal.

                          ETHAN
                Jack.  Jack.

He closes his eyes, knowing what that means.

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

PHELPS also sees the static.

                          PHELPS
                Man down.  Stay where you are.  Im on my
way.

He gets up and races out of the apartment.

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

GOLITSYN, who now has the disk, jabs again and again at the
elevator button but it wont even light up.  He studies the
elevator doors and jumps into the shaft, just as ETHAN and
SARAH did moments before.

He hits the floor of the elevator shaft and exits the small
door at the shafts base.

     EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

PHELPS hurries towards the bridge.

                          PHELPS
                En route.

     EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT

PHELPS dashes onto the Charles Bridge and heads across the
river, toward the Embassy.  He throws a look back, over his
shoulder.  Paranoias setting in.

     EXT. EMBASSY (AS SEEN FROM CHARLES BRIDGE) - NIGHT

Outside the Embassy, GOLITSYN escapes, pushing through the
service area door and racing past a DRUNKEN COUPLE who are in
the midst of a lovers quarrel, in Russian.

Pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where PHELPS is
still racing to meet ETHAN.  But he stops suddenly, as if
hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening
gloom.

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

ETHAN and SARAH hear PHELPS voice over the monitor.

                          SARAH
                The package is in the open.

                          ETHAN
                Jim.  Jim.  Hes in the open.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Ive got a shadow.

                          ETHAN
                Can you lose him?

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                No.  Abort.

Over ETHANs shoulder, SARAH sees GOLITSYN getting away.  Fog
starts to roll over the river towards the bridge.

                          SARAH
                Ethan.  Hes out of pocket.                

                          ETHAN
                     (to Phelps) 
Jim we cant.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Abort.  Thats an order.

                          ETHAN


     INT. GETAWAY CAR - NIGHT

Seated in the getaway car, CLAIRE listens to JIM and ETHAN
argue.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                No, damn it, no, I said ABORT!

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

Outside the Embassy, SARAH and ETHAN argue.

                          ETHAN
                Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im
coming to you.

                          SARAH
                Jim gave an abort, we should walk
away.

                          ETHAN
                No, were going to recover the disk,
understand?!  Now move!

ETHAN takes off for the bridge, leaving SARAH to shadow
     GOLITSYN.

     EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT

HANNAH hurries toward the getaway vehicle.

     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

ETHAN moves to the bridge stairs.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Where are you?

                          ETHAN
                About two hundred yards from the bridge.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Theyre covering this frequency, Ethan.
Cut all radio communications.  Repeat.
Cut all radio communications.  

ETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge.  Past
CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car.  He looks on his monitor
and again sees PHELPS POV.  Only ominous silence.  Phelps is
looking back over his shoulder.  The bridge is deserted.

     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

SARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore, where
a cobblestone promenade runs along the river.  He disappears
into the fog at the edge of the river.

     EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

ETHAN checks his monitor again.

     THE MONITOR

PHELPS point of view changes radically as his head swivels
on the darkened bridge.  He whirls again, looking over his
shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible,
pointing at him and before PHELPS has a chance to react a
GUNSHOT CRACKLES over the monitor.

The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down
to a bloody hole in his own chest.

His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge
and makes the long, hard fall into the river below.



ETHANs face goes white with shock.

                          ETHAN


     EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT

He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but theres
no sign of PHELPS.

ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but
sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming
obscured in the gathering fog.

He turns and looks to the embankment.  He can faintly see
GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade.  ETHAN gives chase.

     EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT

ETHAN runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point
on the top of the stairs, he can see CLAIRES outline,
visible in the drivers seat.  But as he descends the stairs
     --

--the car explodes and bursts into flames.

The force of the blast knocks ETHAN back.

                          ETHAN


He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a 
stunned CROWD starts to gather.

Remembering SARAH, he rushes down the stairs towards the
embankment.

     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees
GOLITSYN again, slowing down.  A MAN comes out of the fog an
seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light.

SARAH draws closer.  Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to
be hanging with her for some reason.

     EXT. STAIRS FROM BRIDGE - NIGHT

ETHAN continues towards the embankment.

     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

SARAH is almost to GOLITSYN.  Suddenly, the MAN in front of
GOLITSYN pulls him towards him.  Sensing something wrong,
SARAH quickens her pace.  The MAN is now hunched over
GOLITSYN, facing away from SARAH, going through GOLITSYNs
pockets.

The figure finds what its looking for -- the disk -- and
takes it.  SARAH comes closer --

-- and the figure whirls.  It brings a knife up sharply,
plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight.

     ANGLE

ETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment.  He bursts
out of the fog, just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees,
over GOLITSYNs body.  ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and
     GASPS.

He pulls the knife out of SARAH, who is close to death.  He
looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated
edge.

     BEHIND ETHAN

The DRUNKEN COUPLE seem drunk no more.  In fact, theyre
watching ETHAN.  Through the fog and night, they see him
leaning over SARAH, holding the knife in his hands.

     AT THE BODIES

SARAH goes still.  ETHAN lays her down, turns the other body
over and sees that it is GOLITSYN.  He quickly begins
rummaging through his pockets.

ETHAN hear police sirens and sees...

     ANGLE

A Prague police boat, SIREN wailing, arrives at the dock in
front of the Embassy.  The DRUNKEN MAN and WOMAN stop
suddenly.

As THREE POLICE leap off the boat and race toward the
explosion, ETHAN leaps over the gate and races up the alley
and out of sight.

     EXT. STREET -- PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

ETHAN unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver.  Hes
holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a 
modernist cockroach.  He CLICKS the cockroach into the guts
of the phones wiring, piercing it with its little prongs.

He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phones tongue
down for a second, releases it and listens.  He has a dial
tone.  Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by
heart.

After a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side.

                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
                Satcom seven.

                          ETHAN
                Central Europe.  Unsecured.

                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
                Designator?

                          ETHAN
                Bravo Echo one one.

                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
                Switching.

There is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the
line.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                This is Kittridge.

                          ETHAN
                Go secure.

Pause.  A funny series of CLICKS comes over the line.      


                Go ahead.

                          ETHAN
                Theyre dead.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Whos dead?

                          ETHAN
                My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim -
- Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know


                Are you damaged?

                          ETHAN
                They knew we were coming.  Golitsyns
dead too.  The disk is gone.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)


                          ETHAN
                Do you read me?  

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Let's just bring you in safely, and then
we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you
followed?

ETHAN closes his eyes.  KITTRIDGES voice is strong and
reassuring and he needs that right now.

                          ETHAN
                I dont think so.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Dont 

                          ETHAN
                Yes.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there
myself.

                          ETHAN
                Youre in Prague?

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont
disappoint me.

                          ETHAN
                No sir.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                One hour.

He hangs up.  ETHAN does the same.  He stares at the phone
for a moment, thinking.  He checks his watch.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the
street.  Every face seems to be starring at him now, every
sound is menacing.  He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his
hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd.

     EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering,
gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by 
residential buildings.

     ETHANS POV

Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built
on the portico of an old palace.

Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively
shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza.

     INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     ETHAN'S POV 

ETHAN walks in the glass front doors, right next to an 
enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. 
He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen PATRONS are 
scattered around. 

EUGENE KITTRIDGE is seated at a table in the middle. He and 
ETHAN make eye contact.  ETHAN walks to the table, a couple 
of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he 
goes.  KITTRIDGE has been working on a pretty good-sized 
lobster.  He rises to greet ETHAN and they sit. 


                I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know 
how much Jim in particular meant to you, 
Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally. 

                          ETHAN 
                Yeah. 

He spots a stack of documents on the table.

ETHAN picks them up.  There's a Canadian picture bearing 
ETHAN photo and the name Phillipe Doucette, credit cards, 
driver's license, etc. 

                          KITTRIDGE
                Passport, visas - you know the drill. 
We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, 
debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague 
police a bone, you know toss them a few 
suspects.  Follow me? 

                          ETHAN 
                Yeah.  I follow you. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                We've lost enough agents for one night. 

                          ETHAN 
                You mean 
night. 

KITTRIDGE seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, 
carefully: 


                You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, 
Ethan. 

                          ETHAN 
                Who else is left? 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Yes.  I see your point. 

                          ETHAN 
                Why was there another team? 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                What? 

                          ETHAN 
                Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                I don't quite follow you. 

                          ETHAN
                Let's see if you can follow me around 
this room. 
(eyes moving around the room) 
The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 
and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing 
around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. 
The waiter behind Hannah at the top of 
the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The 
other IMF team.  You're worried about me. 
Why?

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (a tight little smile) 
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some 
time. 

The figures around the room have grown restless.  KITTRIDGE 
tries to indicate that it's okay. He pulls some papers out 
of his jacket. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                For a little over two years now we've 
been spotting serious blowback in IMF 
operations.  We have a penetration.  The 
other day we decoded a message on the 
Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."

                          ETHAN 
                The arms dealer. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                That's right.  Max, it seems, has two 
unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents. 
This time he's gotten to someone on the 
inside - he's put himself in a position 
to buy our NOC list. An operation he 
referred to as "Job 314".  The job he 
thought Golitsyn was doing tonight. 

                          ETHAN 
                But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Correct the actual list is safe at 
Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, 
one of ours. 

                          ETHAN 
                This whole operation was a molehunt. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like 
you said.  You survived. 

ETHAN stares at him levelly. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)
                I want to show you something, Ethan. 

He now shoves the papers across the table.  They're xeroxed 
copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of DONALD and 
MARGARET ETHAN HUNT.  It shows a balance of $127, 000. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                Since your father's death, your family's 
farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, 
suddenly, they're flush with over a 
hundred and twenty grand in the bank. 
Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped 
out the bank account -- dying slowly in 
America after all, can be a very 
expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why 
don't we go quietly out of here onto the 
plane... 

                          ETHAN 
                How about if we just go quietly into the 
bathroom and I wash your mouth out with 
soap - you pathetic button down 
bureaucratic asshole. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                Ethan, I can understand you're very 
upset. 

                          ETHAN 
                Kitteridge, you've never seen me very 
upset. 

ETHAN takes something from his jacket pocket.  While 
KITTRIDGE talks, ETHAN unwraps whatever is in his hand. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                All right, enough is  enough Hunt. You've 
bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on 
intimate loyalties to get away with it. 
You're determined to shake hands with the 
devil and I'm going to make sure you do 
it in hell. 

We see what ETHAN holds in his hand -- it's the piece of 
bubble gum, half red, half green. He squeezes the gum, 
mushing the two sides together. 

ETHAN lashes out, swatting KITTRIDGE'S glass of wine off the
table in one quick motion.  As he does, he hurls the piece of 
gum. 

Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine 
glass.  KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass -- 

-- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. His eyes 
widen.  KA BOOM! 

The tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish 
tank.  A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and 
WOMAN, knocking them to the ground. 

At the same time, ETHAN bolts for the door. 

     EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the 
deserted square. 

     EXT. SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Silence.  ETHAN enters the darkened entry. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT

ETHAN glances up at the stairwell.  Naked light bulbs 
illuminate the way up.  He slips off his jacket and shirt, 
then puts his jacket back on. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

ETHAN unscrews a bulb.  He crushes the bulb in his shirt and 
scatters the glass fragments on the steps.  He climbs to the 
next bulb. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT

At the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft 
sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth, glass fragments 
dropping and ETHAN'S at the door. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 

In the darkened safe house, ETHAN goes to a vase with 
flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a 
Sig Sauer automatic. He moves through the rooms, checking 
them as he goes. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT

ETHAN checks the shower, then goes to his shaving kit, 
pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can.  He 
unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various 
denominations from various countries and a couple of 
passports. 

As he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the
mirror.  He's a mess.  He splashes water on his face. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

ETHAN greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water 
and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

He comes back into the living room. Still drinking, he 
notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the 
static from the four monitors PHELPS was watching.  One by 
one, he switches them off. 

     THE LAPTOP 

JACK had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk.  ETHAN 
wakes it up. 

     The computer emits a DIAL TONE, then STATIC as it hits its 
connection.  It prompts ETHAN along: 

SELECT USENET GROUP

     ETHAN TYPES IN 

job 314

                          ETHAN
                Job.  Job 3:14.  March fourteen.  Job 31 
March. 

The computer replies: 

SEARCHING STRING NOT FOUND

ETHAN tries again: 

max.com

The answer: 

SEARCH STRING NOT FOUND

He tries a few more, quickly -- "job," "jobs," "joblist.com," 
but nothing comes up.  He tries something else -- "scroll 
usenet groups."  

The computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying 
speed, by the hundreds.  That's not going anywhere. 

ETHAN pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to 
figure out what permutation of "job 314" he should add to the 
others on his computer screen.  He MUMBLES. 

                          ETHAN 
                Job three fourteen.  Job --
(a realization, 
the Biblical pronunciation) 
It's Job! 

He rummages around on the desk, checks the bookshelf and 
finds a Gideon Bible.  He turns to Job 3:14 and reads the 
Bible passage "Kings and Counsellors..." 

He thinks for another moment, then punches back into the 
Internet and under the command "Select Usenet Group" he 
types:

     ETHAN: 

BOOK OF JOB

The computer presents a multi-colored screen of religious 
icons and artwork with an accompanying message: 

WELCOME TO THE BOOK OF JOB DISCUSSION 
                GROUP.  WHICH CHAPTER AND VERSE DO 
                YOU WISH TO POST YOUR ENTRY UNDER?

ETHAN types his answer "Job 3:14" and the screen presents a 
"stickie" for him to write his message on.  He does: 

                          ETHAN 
                Max -- Goods tainted.  Consider extremely 
hazardous.  DO NOT USE.  Fate will be 
that of kings and counsellors who built 
for themselves palaces now lying in 
ruins.  Must meet to discuss a.s.a.p. 

     ANGLE

A rhythmic CRUNCHING sound and from the darkness on the other 
side of the room, PHELPS staggers toward him, wet and muddy, 
his middle a hopelessly bloody mess.  He looks like he's 
dying on his feet.  ETHAN freezes, appalled. 

                          PHELPS
                Ethan, what are you doing? 

ETHAN tries to speak but nothing will come out. 

                          PHELPS (CONT'D) 
                I needed you, Ethan. 1 needed you on the 
bridge, and -- you weren't there.  Ethan? 
Ethan? 

ETHAN reaches out to grab PHELPS but can't seem to touch him. 
PHELPS suddenly vanishes into thin air, ETHAN awakens from 
the dream and finds himself leaping to his feet, gun cocked 
and pointed at -- 

     ANGLE

It's CLAIRE. 

                          ETHAN 
                What are you doing here?! 

CLAIRE freezes, her hands half-raised. 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (carefully) 
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. 
Ethan what's wrong with you? 

                          ETHAN 
                Don't move. 

Her right hand has moved a fraction.  She freezes again. 

                          ETHAN 
                You were in the car! 

                          CLAIRE 
                I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in 
trouble on the radio.  He said someone 
was... 

                          ETHAN 
                Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the 
car. 

                          CLAIRE 
                No, I got out of the car and I ran to the
bridge. 

                          ETHAN 
                Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What happened to Jim? 

                          ETHAN 
                There was nobody on the bridge. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What happened to Jim? 

Ethan grabs her wrists, shouting. 

                          ETHAN 
                Dead.  Dead.  Dead!  Wake up, Claire! 
Jim's dead, they're dead.  They're all 
dead! 

ETHAN releases her wrists. 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (mumbling) 
They're dead.  Jim's dead. 

                          ETHAN
                Take off your coat. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What? 

                          ETHAN 
                Take off your God damn coat! 

He grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her, half- 
spinning her around.  The coat hits the floor like a dead 
body.  CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest. 

CLAIRE begins to shiver.  ETHAN circles her, runs his hand 
cursorily across her body.  It accentuates CLAIRE'S 
shivering. 

                          ETHAN (CONT'D) 
                Where were you? 

                          CLAIRE 
                I walked away.  He said abort.  He was 
gone so I walked away. 

                          ETHAN 
                That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? 
Did they send you here? 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (slowly) 
Who is "they?" 

                          ETHAN 
                Did they send you...Did they send you? 

                          CLAIRE 
                Who is they, who is they? 

ETHAN grabs her by the wrists. 

                          ETHAN 
                Who sent you?!  Who sent you? 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (screaming) 
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be 
back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, 
if we abort, we don't return here until 
four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, 
four o'clock --! 

She sags.  A moment.  Then the clock begins to chime -- BONG, 
BONG, BONG, BONG.  In the wake of the bells' reverb, ETHAN 
releases his grip on her wrists. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT

ETHAN sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, 
still waiting for a response.  CLAIRE sitting on the end of 
the bed.  Dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Why haven't they brought us in yet? 

                          ETHAN
                I've been disavowed.  They think I killed 
Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred 
thousand dollars found its way into my 
parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes 
I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've 
been in the employ of an arms dealer, 
Max, for the last two years, to get him 
our NOC list. 

A long moment while she stares at ETHAN's back. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What are you going to do? 

                          ETHAN 
                I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the 
mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, 
at least part of the time. 1 can't find 
him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, 
he'll find me. 


                Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me 
go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going 
to tell him you had nothing to do... 

                          ETHAN
                Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not 
dead, he's going to assume you're with 
me. 

The computer blinks and makes a noise - ETHAN goes to it. 

     THE COMPUTER SCREEN

Blinking -- "MESSAGE WAITING."  ETHAN hurries over and clicks 
on the message box.  The screen blinks and the message shows 
up: 

?        JOB - CORNER OF NEKAZANKA AND PRlKOPY ONE P.M. 

     ?        BUY A PACKET OF DUNHILL 

     ?        AND ASK THE MAN SITTING ON THE BUS 

?        STOP BENCH FOR A MATCH

CLAIRE looks to ETHAN. 

                          CLAIRE 
                The message is for Job. 

                          ETHAN
                I'm going to answer it. 

     EXT. STREET BY BANK/FLORENC BUS STOP - DAY

ETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade. A 
MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to 
     ETHAN. 

                          ETHAN 
                Excuse me, could I trouble you for a 
match? 

Without turning, the MAN offers up a box of matches. As 
ETHAN takes them, TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm 
and escort him into a car which has just pulled up. 

     INT. CAR - DAY

ETHAN slides into the back seat, between the TWO MEN. 
MATTHIAS, the man on the left, holds up a black hood.  He 
extends it to ETHAN, who doesn't take it. 

                          MATTHIAS
                Would you remove your hat please? 

                          ETHAN 
                Why? 

                          MATTHIAS 
                You wish to meet Max?  This is the price 
of admission. 

Reluctantly, Ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car 
takes off. 

     INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

The black hood still on his head, ETHAN has trouble sitting 
upright.  He's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in 
the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are 
drawn.  The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- 
expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art. 

Somewhere down the block, a dog BARKS, steadily, every few 
seconds. In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone 
is VACUUMING.  MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby. 

                          ETHAN
                I thought I was going to see Max. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                You misunderstood.  No one sees Max. 

                          ETHAN 
                Then what am I doing here? 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Allowing Max to see you and hear what 
you've got to say. 

                          ETHAN 
                I don't communicate very well through a 
shroud. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                If Max doesn't like what you have to say, 
you'll be wearing that shroud 
indefinitely. 

                          ETHAN 
                I'm willing to take the chance. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Very well. 

MAX'S figure into frame.  MATTHIAS removes ETHAN's hood. 
When it comes off ETHAN finds himself looking up at a tall 
woman of indeterminate age.  She's handsome to the point of 
severity. 

                          MAX 
                Who are you and what are you doing here? 


                I need one hundred thousand dollars. 

                          MAX
                Really?  And you thought if you simply 
showed up I might give it to you? 

                          ETHAN 
                Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and 
twenty five thousand. 

                          MAX 
                The penny drops.  
Job is not given to quoting Scripture in 
his communications. And there was its 
tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is 
not playful.  So you're something of a 
paradox. 

                          ETHAN 
                That depends.
