          A SPOTLIGHT reveals RYAN BINGHAM standing at a PODIUM.
 
          He unzips a BACKPACK and sets it down beside him.
 

           How much does your life weigh?
 
          Ryan pauses to let us consider this.
 

           Imagine for a second that you're
carrying a backpack... I want you
to feel the straps on your
shoulders... You feel them?
(gives us a beat)
Now, I want you to pack it with all
the stuff you have in your life.
Start with the little things. The
stuff in drawers and on shelves.
The collectables and knick-knacks.
Feel the weight as it adds up. Now,
start adding the larger stuff. Your
clothes, table top appliances,
lamps, linens, your TV. That
backpack should be getting pretty
heavy at this point - Go Bigger.
Your couch, your bed, your kitchen
table. Stuff it all in... Your car,
get it in there... Your home,
whether you have a studio apartment
or a two story house, I want you to
stuff it into that backpack.
 
          Ryan takes a beat to let the weight sink in.
 

           Now try to walk.
 
          We hear people around us chuckling. Ryan smiles. Reveal:
 



          The kind that shifts between lower income corporate retreats
and lower income weddings.
 
          The few dozen people seem to be visualizing as told.
 

           Kinda hard, isn't it? This is what
we do to ourselves on a daily
basis. We weigh ourselves down
until we can't even move. And make
no mistake - Moving is living.
           2.


          We see nodding. People's gears turning.
 

           Now, I'm going to set your backpack
on fire. What do you want to take
out of it? Photos? Photos are for
people who can't remember. Drink
some gingko and let the photos
burn. In fact let everything burn
and imagine waking up tomorrow with
nothing.
(a beat of emphasis)
It's kind of exhilarating isn't it?
That is how I approach every day.
 
          A titter through the crowd.
 



          A FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT is looking directly at us.
 

           Do you want the cancer?
 
          Turn to see RYAN looking back.
 
          Handsome. Anonymous. Right now - Confused.
 

           Excuse me?
 


           Do you want the cancer?
 
          Ryan furrows - What the hell is going on here?
 
          The flight attendant raises her hand to reveal a CAN OF SODA.
 

           The can, sir?
 

           Oh... No. Um, no thank you.
 
          The flight attendant moves to the next aisle. Ryan takes a
beat, then returns to his work.
 



          Two words - Subordinate chic.
           3.


          Seated at a tiny table is RYAN. The Grim Reaper in a suit.
 
          We see a series of REAL PEOPLE react to the news of being
fired. They should be non-actors (actual victims of recent
layoffs) that can react organically to the news with
authenticity. Some are hurt. Others are upset and even
abusive. The series concludes with...
 



          ... who's on the verge of tears.
 

           Who the fuck are you?
 
          FREEZE on Ryan.
 

           Excellent question. Who the fuck am
I? Poor Steve has worked here for
seven years.
 






           He's never had a meeting with me
before...
 



          Steve in a small meeting.
 

           ...or passed me in the hall...
 



          Steve passes a female coworker.
 

           ... or told me a story in the break
room....
 



          Steve laughs at a coworker's story.
           4.



           And that's because I don't work
here. I work for another company
that lends me out to pussies like
Steve's boss...
 



          Steve's BOSS sits at his desk. Subtitle reads - "A Big Pussy"
 

           ... who don't have the balls to
sack their own employees. And in
some cases, for good reason.
Because, people do crazy shit when
they get fired.
 


          Steve wipes off his boss's desk.
 
          Steve shreds sensitive documents.
 
          Steve pours bleach into the communal coffee pot.
 
          Steve loads an assault rifle. He stands up to get a view of
his coworkers on a coffee break.
 





          Steve is trying to hold it together.
 

           And that's where I come in.
 

           What did I... do? What could I have
done differently here?
 

           This is not an assessment of your
productivity. It's important not to
personalize this.
 
          Steve scoffs at this.
 
          Ryan slides Steve a PACKET.
           5.



           Steve, I want you to review this
packet. Take it seriously. I think
you're going to find a lot of
answers in there.
 


           Oh, I'm sure it's going be really
helpful.
 

           Look, anybody who ever built an
empire, or changed the world, sat
where you are now. And it's because
they sat there that they were able
to do it.
 
          And just for a moment, Steve looks hopeful.
 

           I'm going to need your key card.
 

           Right...
 
          Steve begins removing it from his wallet.
 

           Take the day. Put together your
personal things. Talk to your co-
workers. Tomorrow, go out and get
some exercise. Go for a jog. Give
yourself routines and pretty soon
you'll find your legs.
 
          Steve nods and gets up to leave. Just as he's about to walk
out, he stops and turns back.
 

           Wait, how do I get in touch with you?
 

           Don't worry. We'll be in touch
soon. This is just the beginning.
 
          Steve nods and exits the room.
 

           I'll never see Steve again.
           6.




          The choreography of Ryan's packing is worthy of Tchaikovsky.
 
          A coat slides off a hanger... A travel toothbrush folds
closed like a switchblade... A briefcase clicks onto a roll-
away bag... A hand flips a light switch without looking.
 



          Ryan is at the check out desk.
 

           Do you have your Hilton Honors Card
with you?
 
          Ryan smiles... "Do I?"
 
          He hands it to her, close enough to camera, that we get a
nice big close up of it. She runs the card and the screen
pops up with information that makes her blush.
 

           Oh my God... Do you like, live, at
the Hilton?
 
          Ryan nods in faux modesty.
 



          Ryan pulls up to one of the spaces marked with the #1 GOLD
PRESIDENTS CLUB emblem. He hops out and a uniformed man with a
handheld device begins to punch in the license plate number.
 
          Ryan pulls out his HERTZ PRESIDENTS CLUB CARD and places it
nice and close to lens so we can see it.
 
          The card slides through the handheld device and we see the
DIGITAL NUMBER increase by a few thousand points.
 



          The automated GLASS DOORS slide open. Ryan enters the
concourse and takes a deep breath of the temperately
controlled air. He has arrived.
 

           This is where I live.
 
          Subtitles - "Airworld"
           7.


          Ryan skips the long lines and steps directly into the
AAdvantage Executive Platinum line.
 
          Glorious close-up of Ryan's AAdvantage Executive Platinum
CARD sliding through the AUTOMATED MACHINE. Were it any
sexier, we'd hear a moan. Maybe we even do.
 
          Immediately, the AIRPORT CLERK registers and perks up.
 

           Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.
 

           When I run my card, the system
automatically prompts the desk
clerk to greet me with this exact
statement.
 
          We see it again...
 

           Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.
 
          Ryan nods back to the clerk.
 

           Had my status simply been gold or
God-forbid, silver. I might have
gotten a hello or a smile... Maybe.
 
          Ryan continues to hit buttons, swiftly checking in.
 

           Loyalty is earned and rewarded with
these small touches. It's these kinds
of systemized friendly touches that
keep my world in orbit.
 
          A ticket begins printing. Ryan snaps it up.
 



          Ryan steps up and observes his line choices. He finds a few
Asian businessmen and hops in behind them.
 







          It's a beautiful choreographed ballet of a bag handle
collapsing, shoes coming off, a laptop going in a separate
tray, wallet and watch sliding into a shoe, a boarding card
sliding into a back pocket... both hands always moving,
performing separate actions... It really is gorgeous.
 



          Ryan enters and presents his ADMIRALS CLUB CARD. It has a
hologram. The ADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS immediately smiles.
 

           Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.
 
          Ryan walks past a stack of newspapers on the way to the
buffet, the whole time framed by an enormous window
overlooking the tarmac.
 

           All the things you probably hate
about travelling - The recycled air.
The artificial lighting. The digital
juice dispensers and mini pizzas
stacked to their heat lamps are the
warm reminders that I am home.
 
          With that comment, Ryan slides into a leather club seat. A
DIGITAL DISPLAY reads: "Thank You For Your Loyalty".
 
          He opens his briefcase and pulls out his ITINERARY. He scans
it. We see a string of flights, car rentals, and stays at
Hitons. Then, something makes him frown. He pulls out his
cell phone and dials...
 





          Ryan's assistant, Kevin, is not happy to be there.
 

           Ryan Bingham's office.
 

           You have me in a Dodge Stratus in
Kansas City.
 

           They are completely out of all full
sized sedans...
           9.




           Did you?...
 

           (not the first time)
Yes, I reminded them of your
remarkable #1 Gold Club status and
years in the program. They are moving
mountains to see you in a Sebring.
 

           Fair enough. Any other messages?
 

           Your sister Kara called. Needs to
speak urgently about your sister's
wedding. I told her you were midair
and not even I knew your final
destination.
 

           Well done.
 

           And you got an invitation to speak
at GoalQuest in Vegas.
 
          Ryan pauses.
 

           GoalQuest twenty?
 





          We push in on an EASEL with a SIGN that features RYAN'S
HEADSHOT. Underneath his name, it reads: "What's In Your
Backpack?"
 



          Ryan delivers his speech with a smile.
 

           Every once in a while I do speaking
engagements. Motivational kind of
stuff. But GoalQuest... We're
talking major Tony Robbins shit.
           10.




          Kevin examines the invitation emblazoned with a big "XX".
 

           It's got a hologram. They're calling
it Dos Equis. That's some pretty
major Tony Robbins shit there.
 

           Talk about burying the lead.
                          (EXHALES)
           I'll check in when...
 

           Hold on, I have Craig Gregory for
you...
 

           I... ah, fuck...
 





          Four words - Store-bought sports memorabilia.
 

           How's the road warrior?
 

           Twenty minutes from boarding into a
world of bliss.
 

           Great numbers out of Phoenix. You
know Big Auto is going to drop
another 10K this month.
 

           No kidding?
 

           Yeah, Christmas came early. Wish I
could have you in five places at
once. I need you back in Omaha by
the end of the week.
 

           I thought you needed me everywhere.
           11.



           We got something big - Game
changer.
 

           I don't know why you ever bring me
in. Wherever I go, the money
follows. Let me plant seeds,
they'll grow to Oaks.
 
          Craig checks out a CUTE INTERN.
 

           I'm thinking of planting seeds
right now.
 

           What are we talking about here?
 

           You'll see.
                          (CHANGES DIRECTIONS)
           Today, I took my first crap in two
weeks. Hallelujah.
 

           That's me, hanging up on you.
 

           Good. I love that sound.
 



          Ryan sits one row behind the bulkhead. Left side. Aisle.
 

           To know me is to fly with me. I'm the
aisle, you're the window - trapped.
 
          Reveal - A man next to Ryan. Some BUSINESSMAN between cities.
He talks, drink in hand, but we don't hear him.
 

           We start chatting, impersonally at
first. Our moderate politics, our
sinking opinions on the American
service industry.
           12.





           You recommend a hotel in Tulsa. I
tip you off to a rib joint in Fort
Worth.
 



           You tell me your best joke. I've
heard it before, but listen anyway.
 
          Ryan laughs out loud.
 



           Nothing like turbulence to cement a
bond. Soon you're telling me about
family.
 



           Your wife just went back to work
but you can't intervene because you
sure could use the extra paycheck
and besides, last June she read
some book and woke up one morning a
feminist.
 



           And that if your windfall ever came
through, you'd quit and spend the
rest of your days restoring vintage
speedboats.
(saying it with him)
The water. That's where you belong.
 



          Their PLANE LANDS.
 



          As the plane begins to taxi to the gate, both Ryan and the
Businessman pull out their cards.
           13.



           We exchange cards and slot them next
to countless others.
 
          The dull bell "dings" to let us know it's safe to stand. Ryan
and the Businessman get up and open the overheads.
 

           Fast friends aren't my only
friends, but my best friends.
 



          Ryan and the Businessman walk next to each, now completely
ignoring each other as if they never shared a word.
 

           Sad? Not really. We're a busy bunch.
I'm peaceful. I'm in my element here.
I suppose I'm a sort of mutation, a
new species. I live between the
margins of my itineraries.
 
          Ryan and the Businessman reach a point that separates -
CONNECTING FLIGHTS go left / LONG TERM PARKING goes right.
 
          They share an awkward smile with a nod, then head in their
separate directions.
 



          Ryan is checking out TIES when his cell phone rings. He
checks the I.D.- UNAVAILABLE. He weighs it for a second.
 


           Hello?
 

           Hi Ryan.
 
          Ryan mouths a silent "fuck".
 





          Kara is Ryan's sister. Her home overflows with books, photos,
family collectables, and kid's artwork.
           14.



           Every family has one person who is
the glue. The one who keeps the
genealogy in check. That's my
sister Kara - The glue.
 
          It just so happens that Kara is GLUING her daughter's school
project mobile together.
 

           Hey Kara.
 

           How are you holding up?
 

           Just fine. You? The kids?
 


           Missy's outstanding. Matthew made
varsity. How's the road?
 
          Ryan exits the store and we realize we are in...
 



          Ryan hops onto a PEOPLE MOVER.
 

           Couldn't be better.
 

           That's good. So, Ryan?
 


           Yeah?
 

           I didn't even want to have to ask you
for this, because I know how you are
about... doing things for others...
 
          Ryan rolls his eyes.
 

           But we're coming in on three weeks
to go for Julie's wedding and
there's something we could really
use your help on.
           15.



          Yeah.
 

          We've been sending people these kits
so they can print out photos of Julie
and Jim on cardboard, and take photos
of them in interesting places kind of
like that gnome in the French movie.
 

          Why?
 


          Because it's Julie's wedding... and she
thinks it's fun. Does it matter why?
 

          How is Julie?
 

          Would you call her? She thinks
you've turned to butter -
Disappeared. You're awfully
isolated, the way you live.
 

          Isolated? I'm surrounded.
 

          Your assistant told me you're going
to be in Vegas.
 

          Did he?
 

          Can you get a photo of the cut-out
in front of the Luxor Pyramid?
 

          That place is a shit hole. No one
stays there.
 

          Jesus, Ryan, I'm not asking you to check
in. Can you just take a stupid photo?
 

          I'm going to try my best.
 

          Well, thank you for trying your best.
           16.




          Ryan sits at one of the couch 
over some paperwork. He notices an attractive professionally
dressed woman, ALEX, sifting through her purse. She sets a
pair of car keys with a MAESTRO TAG on the table.
 

           You're satisfied with Maestro?
 

           Yeah, I am.
 

           They're stingy with their miles. I
like Hertz.
 

           Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.
If a car's over twenty-thousand
miles, I won't drive it.
 
          Ryan is intrigued.
 

           Maestro doesn't instant check out.
I like to park and go.
 

           Hertz doesn't guarantee Navigation.
 

           Funny, you don't seem like a girl
who needs directions.
 

           I hate asking for directions.
That's why I get a Nav.
 

           The new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.
 

           Is that a joke?
 
          After a beat.
 

           Yes.
 

           Their kiosk placement is a joke.
           17.



           Never have available upgrades.
 


           It's basically a fleet of shit
boxes - Don't know how they're
still in business.
 

           (I love you)
I'm Ryan.
 

           Alex.
 

           So are you going to join me?
 
          She breaks into a smile.
 





          Empty glasses litter the table. Ryan and Alex have taken over
a couch and have the contents of their wallets spread out -
All MEMBERSHIP CARDS.
 

           (grabs one of Alex's cards)
Maplewood Card? How dare you bring
that into this palace.
 

           Hilton offers equal value and
better food - But the Maplewood
gives out warm cookies at check in.
 

           They got you with the cookies?
 

           I'm a sucker for simulated
hospitality.
 

           There's actually an industry term
for that. It's a mixture of faux
and homey. It's faumey.
 
          Alex grabs Ryan's AMERICAN CONCIERGE KEY CARD.
           18.



          Oh my God. I've heard about these,
but never seen one in person. Is
this a...?
 

          Concierge Key. Yeah.
 

          I love the weight.
 

          Graphite. I was pretty excited the
day that puppy came in.
 

          I'll say. I put up pretty
pedestrian numbers. Sixty thou a
year, domestic.
 


          That's not bad.
 

          Don't patronize me. What's your total?
 

          That's a personal question.
 

          Oh please...
 


          I hardly know you.
 

          Show some hubris. Impress me.
                          (SUGGESTIVE)
          I bet it's huge.
 

          You have no idea.
 

          Come on...
(holds her hands eight
                          INCHES APART)
          Is it this big?
(extends a few inches)
... this big?
           19.



           Let's just say I've got a number in
mind and I haven't hit it yet.
 
          Alex smiles, fair enough. Admires the CONCIERGE KEY CARD.
 

           This is pretty fucking sexy.
 

           I hope it doesn't cheapen our
relationship.
 

           We're two people who get turned on
by elite status. We may have to
settle for cheap.
 

           There's nothing cheap about
loyalty.
 
          Alex looks into Ryan's eyes and gives him unspoken permission
to take her right there and then.
 



          Ryan and Alex walk down a curved corridor, suppressing
laughter. There's no adult way to go back to somebody's
hotel room. Once at the door, Ryan tries his KEY CARD, but
it doesn't work.
 
          He reaches into his pocket and comes up with five other key
cards from recent trips.
 

           I really have to start throwing
these out.
 
          He tries a couple.
 

           We can always use that room with
the ice machine.
 
          Ryan chuckles. He finds the right key and opens the door.
 



          Everything is scattered from a marathon Fuck. Ryan and Alex
are laying on the bed, sprawled out on their backs like
murder victims.
           20.



           Good call on the towel rack.
 

           Thanks. I liked how you burritoed
me in the sofa cushions.
 

           I was improvising.
 

           Too bad we didn't make it to the
closet.
 

           We got to do this again.
 






           I'm in Newark on the 12th, Madesto
on the 13th, Oklahoma City on the
15th.
 

           Any Southwest? I'm swinging through
Albuquerque the week of the 16th?
 

           No, but I'll be in Florida by the 20th.
 

           Miami?
 

           Ft. Lauderdale.
 

           That's nothing.
 

           Forty minutes.
 
          They simultaneously type each other into their calendars.
 

           I should probably go back to my
room so I can wake up in my bed.
           21.



           I think that's the lady like thing
to do.
 



          Ryan drops Alex off at her door. She flips the "do not
disturb" on her door handle and kisses Ryan good night.
 
          The door closes. Ryan smiles to himself.
 



          Sprinklers doing their job. One's broken.
 



          Looking through the first floor window, we see Ryan doing
laps in the pool.
 



          Ryan gets a shoe shine.
 



          The CLERK swipes Ryan card.
 



          A CAR RETURN CLERK slides Ryan's card through a device.
 



          Ryan SWIPES his FREQUENT FLIER CARD through the automated
machine.
 
          A FEMALE DESK ASSISTANT notices the number, looks up at Ryan,
and has a tiny orgasm right there.
 



          Ryan looks out the OVAL WINDOW to the landscape of Omaha.
           22.



           Last year, I spent three hundred
twenty two days on the road.
 



          Ryan wheels passed a couple that leaps into each other's arms.
 

           Which means that I had to spend
forty three miserable days at home.
 



          Ryan steps up to an upscale building with little character,
searching for his keys at the bottom of his bag. Finally
finds them and opens the front door.
 



          Ryan presses his floor, when a NOSEY NEIGHBOR slides in.
 

           Ryan?
 

           (doesn't know his name)
Hi...
 

           Feels like it's been months, busy man.
We missed you at our Summer party.
 

           Yeah, sorry I couldn't be there.
 

           We've been trying to get a vote on
the new landscaping. Can I e-mail you
the plans...? We'd love to get a
final tally.
 

           It's fine. Really. I'll go with the
majority.
 

           Sometimes I forget that you even
live here. You could probably save
money and move into a hotel.
           23.




           I looked into it, but the IRS
requires a permanent address for
employment. Otherwise, they
classify you as a vagrant.
 
          Ding! - Ryan gets off at his floor.
 

           Oh.
 



          Ryan walks in and sets his bag down. Reveal - the place is
empty... Like empty, empty.
 
          Ryan opens the fridge - Chinese take out. Pizza box. Bottle
of Vodka. Takes a whiff of something - not good.
 

           Hey neighbor.
 
          Ryan turns to find Dianne, a pretty woman just shy of forty.
 

           Hey yourself.
 
          They hug - It's just intimate enough to know they've violated
the rules of sleeping with your neighbors.
 

           (hands over a package)
I signed for this while you were gone.
 

           Thanks. Hope it wasn't a bother.
 
          Ryan opens it and finds the CUT-OUT of his sister Julie and
her fiance Jim. It's an eighteen inch card stock photo of Jim
hugging Julie from behind.
 


           They seem happy.
 

           It's my sister. She's getting
married. Haven't met the guy yet.
 

           Lots of luck.
           24.



           I know, right?
 
          They share a smile. Then, Dianne goes to leave.
 

           It's good to see you. Feels like a
while this time.
 

           Hey, you want to come over tonight?
 
          Dianne gets a little uncomfortable.
 

           Actually, I kind of started seeing
somebody.
 

           Oh, that's... that's great.
 

           Yeah, we're having drinks tonight
if you want to come over.
 

           That's okay... I' think I'll settle in.
 
          Dianne gives a smile/nod and exits. Ryan take another long
look at the CUT-OUT. He shakes his head.
 



          A downtown midsize high rise.
 



          The company has piled in, standing room only. Assistants and
interns watch through the windows.
 
          Craig addresses the group including his own superiors.
 

           Just thrilled to have everyone
under one roof. Welcome home boys.
 
          A couple odd looks from road warriors a decade his senior.
 

           I know there's are lot of
whispering about why we're all
here.

           Retailers are down twenty percent.
Auto industry is in the dump.
Housing market doesn't have a
heartbeat. This is our moment. It's
one of the worst times on record
for America... and I don't want to
be standing here two years from
now, wondering how we missed this
window of opportunity.
 
          A strangely encouraged response from the group.
 

           Now, last Summer we received a
dynamite young woman by way of
Cornell. She challenged us with some
big ideas. My first reaction was, who
does this kid think she is? But when I
started to give a listen, I was pretty
knocked out. So now, with a little
peek into our future - Natalie Keener.
 
          Natalie stands up.
 

           If there's one word I want to leave
you with today, it's this...
 
          Natalie clicks on her POWER POINT PRESENTATION.
 


          Everyone including Ryan attempts to pronounce it.
 

           Glocal.
 



           Our global must become local.
 
          POWER POINT SLIDE: A slide shows PEOPLE X 250.
 

           This company keeps twenty three
people on the road, at least two
hundred fifty days a year. It's
expensive and it's inefficient.
When I came to Craig three months
ago with this, he told me, and
quite astutely - it's only a
problem if you have a solution.
                          (MORE)



           Well, today I stand before you with
jus that.
 
          She turns around and fires up her monitor. Sitting in a video
conference session is a young man in a suit.
 

           You all know Ned in reception.
 
          Various people say hello to Ned.
 

           Today, I'm going to fire Ned.
                          (ASIDE)
           Sorry, Ned. I'm sure H.R. will hire
you back this afternoon.
 
          Ned smiles. People chuckle in the conference room. One guy
jokes "Don't count on it."
 

           Ned could be any employee in any one
of our client's locations worldwide.
Strategy packets would be shipped in
advance. Ned would be given a seat
and find one of our transition
specialists waiting for him.
 
          Natalie turns to the monitor and proceeds to fire Ned. It is
a pretty dry process and lacks Ryan's charm.
 

           Mr. Laskin, the reason we're having
this conversation today is your
position is no longer available.
 

           (from a script)
I don't understand. I'm fired?
 

           Hearing the words "You've been let
go" is never easy. Change is always
scary. But consider the following -
(using Ryan's line)
Anybody who ever built an empire,
or changed the world, sat where you
are now. And it's because they sat
there that they were able to do it.
 


           That's my fucking line.
           27.



           Well, what happens now?
 

           This is the first step of a process
that will end with you in a new job
that fulfills you.
 

           Yeah, but, how does it work?
 

           I want you to take that packet in
front of you.
 
          Ned picks up the packet.
 

           Review it. All the answers you're
looking for are inside. Start
filling out the necessary
information and before you know it,
you'll be on your way to new
opportunities.
 
          Ned starts to peruse the packet with fake interest.
 

           Now Ned, I'm going to need you to
go back to your desk and start
putting together your things. As a
favor to me, I'd appreciate it if
you didn't spread the news just
yet. Panic doesn't help anybody.
 

           I understand.
 

           Have a good day, Mr. Laskin and
good luck with your future.
 

           Thank you.
 
          Ned gets up and goes to leave.
 

           Give it up for Ned.
 
          People clap and tease him a little.

          POWER POINT: An animation of one monitor becoming multiple
monitors, all tied into a central switch board in the middle
of a map of the country.
 

           You can start the morning in
Boston, stop in Dallas over lunch
and finish the day in San
Francisco. All for the price of a
T1 line. Our inflated travel budget
is eviscerated by eighty-five
percent... And most importantly to
you guys on the road... No more
Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa...
No more hours lost to weather
delays... You get to come home.
 
          Ryan is in a state of silent panic.
 



          Ryan enters and stops short.
 

           Tell me you're not taking this
seriously.
 

           Yeah, that's why we brought the
entire company in from the road -
Because we're not taking this
seriously.
 

           It doesn't make any sense. It's...
                          (SEARCHING)
           ... completely impersonal.
 

           Who am I even talking to?
 

           There's a methodology to what I do.
A reason why it works.
 

           Ryan, Coke and IBM have been doing
it for years. Just like anything,
there's a few months of transition,
but everyone settles in.
 

           Who are you taking off the road?
           29.


          A beat.
 

           You don't get it. You're grounded, Ryan.
Everyone is. It's done.
 

           Okay, what we do here is brutal and
leaves people devastated, but there's
a dignity to the way I do it.
 

           Stabbing people in the chest
instead of the back?
 
          Ryan rolls his eyes.
 
          Craig's door opens and Natalie pops her head in.
 

           You wanted to see me?
 
          Craig goes to wave her off.
 

           Yeah, why don't you come in.
 
          Natalie is confused but takes the chair next to Ryan.
 

           Great job in there, Nat.
 

           Thank you. How's everyone taking it?
 
          Natalie and Ryan hold a look for a second.
 


           Look, I appreciate your... zeal. And
you have some good ideas. But you
know nothing of the realities of my
job. Sure, you can set up an iChat...
but you don't know how people think.
 

           Actually, I minored in psychology.
 

           Nice.
 


           Okay kiddo, fire me.
           30.



           Ryan, stop it.
 

           She's going to be doing this on a
regular basis. You don't want to
know if she can fire somebody?
 

           She just fired Ned.
 

           My dog could fire Ned.
                          (TO NATALIE)
           Fire me.
 

           Ryan.
 

           It's okay, I got this.
 
          Ryan and Natalie turn to face each other.
 

           Mr. Bingham, I regret to inform you
that your position is no longer
available.
 

           Who the hell are you?
 

           My name is Miss Keener and I'm here
today to discuss your future.
 

           My future? I don't know you. The
only person who can fire me is
Craig Gregory.
 

           Mr. Gregory hired me to handle this
for him.
 

           Handle what? Handle me? Mr. Gregory
hired me and he's the only one who can
fire me. I'm going to talk to him.
 
          Ryan gets up. Natalie gets up too.
 

           Mr. Bingham...
           31.



           You can't follow me... You're on a
computer screen. Remember?
 


           Ryan...
 
          Ryan sits back down.
 

           Try again. Fire me.
 

           I just did.
 

           Actually, you didn't. Now, fire me.
 

           Stop it, Ryan.
 


           Mr. Bingham, I'm here today to
inform you that your position is no
longer available.
 

           I'm fired?
 

           Yes, you're fired.
 


           Never say fired.
 

           You've been let go.
 

           Why?
 

           (breaks the moment)
This is a mythical situation. How
could I possibly know why?
 

           You never know why. Why doesn't
matter.
           32.



           (back on track)
It's important not to focus on the
"why" and rather to spend your
energy thinking about your future.
 

           I'm going to spend my energy on
suing you if you don't give me a
reason that you're firing me.
 

           Mr. Bingham, the reason is not
important.
 

           Oh, so you're firing me without
grounds.
                          (TO CRAIG)
           Now, I really have a lawsuit.
 

           Ryan, I think we know what you're
trying to say...
 

           (still in character)
Don't take this personally, Mr.
Bingham.
 
          Ryan stops.
 

           Personally?
(quiet and calm)
This is the most personal situation
you will ever enter. So before you
try to revolutionize my business,
I'd like to know that you actually
know my business.
 



          Ryan is staring out his window watching a plane take flight.
 
          Craig enters.
 

           Hell-of-a-way to welcome her to the
team.
           33.



           Am I the only one who sees that by
automating our own business, we're
making ourselves irrelevant.
 

           (frankly...)
No... We're making you irrelevant.
 
          Ryan shoots a look.
 

           Hey, don't blame me. Blame fuel
costs. Blame insurance premiums.
Blame technology.
                          (A BEAT)
           Watch yourself, Ryan. You're too
young to be a dinosaur...
 

           I'm not... I'm not a dinosaur.
 

           I want you to show her the ropes.
 

           What do I know about what happens
around here? Have Ferguson do it.
 

           I'm not talking about here.
 
          A beat as Ryan registers what Craig means: The Road.
 

           No.
 

           Hey, you seem pretty confident that this
girl doesn't know what she's doing...
 

           Excuse me. I just don't think a
MySpace page qualifies you to
rewire an entire company.
 

           Great. Well, here's your chance.
Show her the magic. Take her
through the paces.
 

           I'm not a fucking tour guide.
           34.


          Craig cups one of his hands and places a FOLDED POST-IT
between his fingers like a ship's sail.
 

           (re: his hand)
This is the boat.
 
          Craig raises his other finger far away.
 

           (re: his finger)
This is you.
 
          A beat of Ryan taking in this ridiculous illustration.
 

           Do you want to be in the boat?
 

           Yes. Alone.
 

           Ryan, we're ringing the bell.
Rounding everybody up. If you want
to stay out there a little longer,
you can. But you're not going to be
on your own.
(begins to leave)
Let me know.
 
          Ryan churns.
 



          Ryan is packing his ROLL-AWAY BAG. It is practiced and
systematic. He's just about finished, when he notices the CUT-
OUT of his sister's engagement photo.
 
          He tries placing it in the open bag, but it is immediately
clear that the photo is two inches to long. He tries putting
it on an angle, but that doesn't help.
 

           Huh.
 
          Ryan centers the cut-out again and tries to ZIP around it,
but he can't get the zipper around the HEADS of the photo.
For a moment, it almost seems like he's assaulting their tiny
head with the zipper handle. Doesn't help.
 
          A moment of silent frustration.
 






          Being pulled through an airport. The little heads of Ryan's
sister and her fiance are poking out the top of the bag. The
two zippers have been closed on either side of them as though
they were tiny passengers peeking out the sunroof.
 



          Ryan cuts right through the crowd, wheeling his carry-on
towards the automatic check-in machines.
 
          Ryan stops when he notices NATALIE saying goodbye to her
BOYFRIEND - a kind of Hollister looking guy in his mid-
twenties. He's not thrilled by the public affection. After a
beat, they break and he exits.
 
          Natalie sees Ryan and starts dragging her LARGE SUITCASE
towards him. The SCRAPING against the terrazzo sends a shiver
up Ryan's spine.
 
          She arrives and sets the heavy bag down with a CLUNK. Ryan
stares at her travel case for a beat then up to her.
 

           What?
 








          Ryan pulls one out and tests the action.
 

           I really like my luggage.
 

           That's exactly what it is. Luggage.
(off of Natalie's look)
You know how much time you lose by
checking in?
 

           I don't know, maybe five minutes
waiting for...
           36.



           Thirty five minutes per flight. I
travel two hundred seventy days a
year. That makes one hundred fifty
seven hours... That's Seven Days.
(points to her luggage)
You ready to throw away a whole
week on that?
 



          Natalie is attempting to repack her new bag in the middle of
the airport. Ryan helps by throwing a couple things out.
 



          Ryan spots various "bad lines", then sees a group of Asians.
 

           Bingo. Asians.
 
          Ryan starts walking.
 

           You can't be serious.
 
          As they pass the first line - A FAMILY OF SIX.
 

           Never get behind people travelling
with infants. I've never seen a
stroller collapse in less than
twenty minutes.
 
          Second Line - AN ELDERLY COUPLE
 

           Old people are worse. Their bodies
are littered with hidden metal and
they never seem to appreciate how
little time they have left on Earth.
 
          Third Line - A COUPLE MIDDLE EASTERN GUYS.
 

           Five words. Randomly selected for
additional screening.
 
          They enter the fourth line behind the Asians.
           37.



           Asians. They're light packers,
treasure efficiency, and have a thing
for slip-on shoes. God love'em.
 

           That's racist.
 

           I'm like my mother. I stereotype.
It's faster.
 



          Ryan is just fastening his belt, having just gone through
security, when we hear a beeping go off. Natalie is trying to
find the metal on her body that has set off the machine. She also
has forgotten to take her laptop out of her bag. It's a mess.
 



          Ryan is sketching a theoretical book cover for "The
Backback". Natalie is working on an Excel Document on her
laptop - She's a loud tapper... Hitting the keys with violent
strokes. It draws Ryan's attention and a raised eyebrow.
 

           Are you upset at your laptop?
 

           No. Why?
 

           Fats Domino had a lighter touch.
 

           I type with purpose.
 

           What are you working on so
furiously?
 

           I'm building a work flow of firing
techniques. Questions & responses.
Actions & reactions. A script that
works kind of like a tributary,
taking you through the steps of
firing someone.
 

           Who is it for?
           38.



           Theoretically, you could put it in
the hands of anybody and they could
be downsizing immediately. All they
have to do is follow the steps.
 

           Natalie, what is it, you think we
do here?
 

           We prepare the newly unemployed for
the emotional and physical hurdles
of job hunting while... Minimizing
potential legal blowback?
 

           That's what we're selling. But it's
not what we're doing.
 

           Okay, what are we doing?
 

           Our job is to make limbo tolerable -
To ferry wounded souls across the
river of dread and humiliation to
the point at which hope's bright
shore is dimly visible...
                          (FRANKLY)
           And then to stop the boat, shove'em
in the water, and make them swim
while we row back to the palace of
their banishment to present the
employers with our bills.
 

           That was really impressive. You
rehearse that?
 
          Natalie smiles and goes back to her work. Ryan goes to say
something, but holds back for now.
 



          Ryan zips through the wandering types as Natalie tries to
keep up. Ryan's phone rings. He sees the caller ID. Smiles.
 


           I got to grab this. I'll meet you
at the rental lot.
           39.


          Natalie nods and keeps moving. Ryan picks up.
 

           Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.
 





          Alex is on her cell phone as a junior behind her folds a
portable projector screen.
 

           I'm in Hotlanta. I need a rib joint
recommend bad.
 


           Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.
 
          Ryan turns into an elevator well to talk.
 

           You haven't called.
 

           You know, I didn't know what was
appropriate...
 
          Alex stops. She moves to a quieter place.
 

           Ryan, I'm not some waitress you
banged in a snow storm. The word
"Appropriate" has no place in our
collective vocabulary. I'm the woman
you don't have to worry about.
 

           This sounds like a trick.
 

           Next time you're worried about
manners - Don't. If you want to
call - Call. Just think of me as
yourself... only with a vagina.
 
          Ryan lights up... This woman fucking rocks. Then recovers.
 

           When am I going to see you?
           40.



           I'm out of Hartsfield, into IAD,
then a connection at ORD into SDF.
 


           Oh... sorry.
 

           Tell me about it.
 

           How long is your layover in O'Hare?
They've got multiples into SDF...
Think you could push?
 


           I can push.
 
          Joy.
 



          Ryan and Natalie ride, briefcases in hand. Natalie is swaying
back and forth. Ryan notices. Is she nervous? Excited?
 
          Ding - The elevator door opens.
 



          Ryan and Natalie enter the door to find a reception desk on
an empty floor. Scattered telephones sit on the ground where
desks used to be. A few desks in one corner are still manned.
 
          Natalie tries not to show: It's all becoming very real.
 

           (to desk girl)
Ryan Bingham, from CTC.
 
          The desk girl looks up from her work. She knows who they are.
 



          Ryan and Natalie pass rows of cubicles. Heads begin to pop up
to see their arrival. Natalie accidentally makes eye contact
with one guy, then quickly shifts her gaze forward.
           41.




          Ryan and Natalie sit next to each other at a polyurethane
conference table.
 

           All you have to do today is watch
and listen. When I talk about the
strategy packet. You hand them one
of these...
 
          Ryan points to a stack of packets.
 

           You ever find it strange that
termination comes with a packet.
 

           Everything important in life comes
with a packet.
 



          A SERIES OF REAL PEOPLE sit down across from Ryan and Natalie
 

           Thank you for coming by. As you're
probably well aware, this is a
tough economic climate and your
company is not immune.
 
          REAL PEOPLE tighten up as they begin to catch on.
 

           While I wish I was here with better
news, the reason you and I are
meeting is this is your final week
of employment here.
 
          REAL PEOPLE blame all sorts of people and situations that
they personally hold responsible.
 

           This is not a time to look for
blame. Your position simply no
longer exists.
 
          REAL PEOPLE respond further. Some are enraged. Some are
polite. One is even grateful.
 

           I understand why you are saying
these things.
                          (MORE)



           It's perfectly natural to feel
this way. I want you to take the
next week to explore this strategy
packet...
 
          Ryan nods to Natalie who we now see begrudgingly HANDING
PACKETS to all of the REAL PEOPLE we've already met.
 

           Fill out the skill set work
sheet... Use the hopes and dreams
diagram... And the tree of
aspirations.
 
          We SEE the "TREE OF ASPIRATIONS" sheet.
 


           The answers are all in there.
 
          We see more packets getting handed out as Ryan repeats...
 

           The answers are all in there.
                          (ANOTHER PERSON)
           The answers...
                          (ANOTHER PERSON)
           The answers...
                          (ANOTHER PERSON)
           ... are-all-in-there.
 






           And what do you suggest I tell
them?
 
          BOB. Dry red eyes from tears of rage stare down the lens.
 
          Natalie can't hold back any longer.
 


           Perhaps you're underestimating the
positive effect your career transition
may have on your children.
 
          Ryan looks at Natalie like she's out of her mind.
 

           Positive effect?
           43.



           Well, tests have shown that
children under moderate trauma have
a tendency to apply themselves
academically as a method of coping.
 

           Go fuck yourself. That's what my
kids'll think.
 
          Natalie shrinks. Ryan immediately covers.
 

           Your children's admiration is
important to you?
 

           Yeah. It was.
 


           Well, I doubt they ever admired
you, Bob.
 
          Bob looks up shocked and pissed.
 

           Hey asshole, aren't you here to
console me?
 

           I'm not a shrink, Bob. I'm a wake
up call. You know why kids love
athletes?
 

           Because they screw lingerie models.
 

           No, that's why we love athletes.
Kids love them because they follow
their dreams.
 

           Yeah, well I can't dunk.
 

           But you can cook.
 
          Natalie looks to Ryan - Where is he going with this?
 

           What are you talking about?
           44.


          Ryan picks up Bob's resume.
 

           Your resume says you minored in
French Culinary Arts. Most students
work the frier at KFC. You bussed
tables at Il Picatorre to support
yourself. Then you got out of
college and started working here.
(looks up at Bob)
How much did they first pay you to
give up on your dreams?
 


           Twenty seven thousand a year.
 

           At what point were you going to
stop and go back to what made you
happy?
 
          Bob simply shrugs.
 

           Do you believe in fate, Bob?
 

           Fate?
 

           Yeah. You know, the mysterious ways
in which we wind up doing the
things we were meant to do.
 


           I met my wife at a gas station.
 

           Exactly. Well, I think fate is
telling you to do something, Bob.
 
          Bob looks up and meets eyes with Ryan.
 

           I see guys who work for the same
company their entire lives. Clock
in. Clock out. Never a moment of
happiness.
(pauses for effect)
Not everyone gets this kind of
opportunity.
                          (MORE)



           The chance for rebirth. If not for
yourself... Do it for your kids.
 
          Bob's eyes begin to water again. He's a changed man.
 
          Ryan shoots Natalie a look - Hand over the packet.
 
          Natalie jumps to attention and hands Bob a packet.
 



          There's a BUSINESS WOMAN waiting in the regular line. Ryan
walks right past her and gets into the ELITE LINE. They are
now both first in their respective lines for the counter.
 
          The woman looks over at Ryan and sighs. Natalie holds back,
confused by Ryan's actions and wanting to avoid confrontation.
 
          The DESK CLERK frees up and gestures for Ryan to step
forward. Ryan begins wheeling his bag forward. Meanwhile, the
woman lifts her hand in outrage.
 

           I've been waiting ten minutes. He just
waltzes in and gets to cut in line.
 

           We reserve priority assistance for
our Hilton Honors members.
 
          Ryan grabs a BROCHURE for ELITE MEMBERSHIP off the desk and
hands it to the business woman.
 

           You should look into it - The
promotions are great...
 
          The woman bats it out of Ryan's hand onto the floor.
 

           Fuck off.
 
          Ryan looks back at the desk clerk and smiles. The desk clerk
swipes his card.
 
          Ryan's DIGITAL NUMBER bumps up another thousand points.
 



          Natalie is washing her hands, when she stops to look at
herself in the mirror.
           46.


          After a beat, she hears someone CRYING in one of the stalls.
She goes to see if the woman is okay, then stops herself -
Maybe I fired her.
 
          She grabs a paper towel, dries off her hands, and leaves.
 



          Natalie sits back down at the table a little visibly shaken.
 

           You okay?
 


           Yeah. Fine.
 
          Just then, their food arrives... And there's a lot of food.
Natalie's eyes move back and forth trying to figure out why
there seems to be three main courses and a bunch of sides.
 

           Hungry, much?
 

           Our expense account allots for forty
dollars each on dinner. I plan on
grabbing every mile I can.
 

           Okay, you got to fill me in on this mile
business. What's that all about? Are you
talking like frequent flier miles?
 
          Ryan gives Natalie a look - Is she ready for this information?
 

           Your really want to know?
 


           I'm dying to know.
 

           I don't spend a nickel, if I can help
it, unless it somehow profits my
mileage account. I'm not talking
hotel rooms and rental cars either,
but internet services, cell phone,
music downloads, teleflorists. The
works. I shop them according to the
miles they pay and I pit them against
each other for the most value.
           47.



           So, what are you saving up for?
Hawaii? South of France?
 

           No, it's not like that... The miles
are the goal.
 

           That's it? You're saving to save?
 

           Let's just say I've got a number in
mind and haven't hit it yet.
 

           Wow. Seems a little abstract.
What's your target?
 

           I'd rather not.
 


           It's a secret target?
 

           It's ten million miles.
 

           Huh. Isn't ten million just a number?
 

           Pi is just a number.
 

           I guess we all need a hobby.
 
          Ryan looks back at Natalie - Hobby?
 

           Oh hey, I didn't mean to belittle your
collection. I get it. Sounds cool.
 

           I'd be the seventh person to do it.
More people have walked on the moon.
 

           Do they give you a parade or something?
           48.



           Lifetime Exec Platinum status. You
get to meet the Chief Pilot,
Maynard Finch. And... They put your
name on the side of a plane.
 

           Men get such a hard-on from putting
their name on stuff... You guys
don't grow up - You just need to
pee on everything.
 

           Now, who's stereotyping?
 

           Fear of mortality. It's like Yes,
you're going to die one day.
 

           And why do you suppose that's singular
to men?
 

           Probably cause you can't have babies.
 
          Ryan can't help but laugh a little.
 

           If I had that many miles, I'd just
show up at the airport, look up at
one of those big destination
boards, pick a place and go.
 
          This idea sinks in for a second with both of them.
 



          Ryan is laying in bed wearing a Hilton bathrobe. He's
reviewing his sister's wedding invite when his BLACKBERRY
BUZZES on the night stand. He reaches over to check it. It's
a text message:
 
          Alex: "Can't fall asleep."
 
          Ryan types back:
 
          Ryan: "Me too. Just laying here."
 






          Alex is in a t-shirt, lying in bed. She types away at her
BLACKBERRY and presses SEND.
 
          Ryan's BLACKBERRY BUZZES again.
 
          Alex: "You should rub one out."
 


           Thanks for the advice.
 
          Types back.
 
          Ryan: "Only fair if you do too."
 
          BLACKBERRY BUZZES again.
 
          Alex: "Way ahead of you."
 

           Man alive.
 
          Ryan: "Call me next time so I can listen."
 
          Alex: ";) Have sweet dreams about me."
 
          Ryan smiles. He stares at the message for a second, then sets
the blackberry down and turns off the light.
 



          Natalie is standing with a camera in her hands, giving
directions.
 

           Left, left, left, left... one more
inch... and stop.
 
          Reveal: Ryan is placing the CUT-OUT of Julie and Jim.
 
          The camera POV makes it look like Julie and Jim are standing
in front of St. Louis International Airport.
 

           I don't get it.
 

           My sister is cooky. She thinks this is
charming... Like the gnome thing.
           50.



           No, I mean... why would your sister
want a fake photo in front of the
St. Louis Airport?
 

           She should be so lucky to visit Lambert
Field. The Wright Brothers flew through
there...
(points out the conical
                          MAIN TERMINAL)
           The domed main terminal was the
first of its kind. A precursor to
everything from JFK to DeGualle.
 


           Wow. Pretty sweet.
 
          Natalie takes the photo.
 


           Why she wants dozens of reminders
of all the places she hasn't been
is beyond me.
 

           Well, I'm sure she's going to be
crushed for having missed this airport.
 

           Look - Before Lindbergh could cross
the Atlantic, he took off from one of
those runways... Ever wondered why
they call it the Spirit of St. Louis?
 


           No.
 
          Ryan goes to say something, but Natalie is already gone.
 



          Ryan and Natalie sit stoically as a YOUNG ASIAN GUY rants
about why they are idiots to fire him.
 

           ... And another thing...? You know
how fucked this place is without me?
You know how fucked this place is
without me? Fucked in the ass, man.
                          (MORE)


           YOUNG ASIAN GUY (cont'd)
I am the one thing preventing this
place from being totally fucked in
the ass.
 
          The young asian guy snaps up one of the PACKETS and leaves,
slamming the door behind himself.
 

           Sometimes, they just need to vent.
 

           Please, for the love of God, can I
fire the next one?
 
          Ryan gives it some thought.
 





          A professional African-American woman wearing a smart suit
sits down at the conference table.
 
          Natalie sits up.
 

           I'm here to be fired, right?
 

           We're here to talk about your future.
 

           You don't have to sugar coat it. I get
the drill. What are they offering?
 

           Inside the packet you'll find a
clearly worked out severance package.
 

           Give me the bullet points.
 

           Three months pay. Six months
medical. A full year of placement
services through our company, CTC.
 

           Placement services? How generous.
           52.



           Commonly, it takes one month of
searching for every ten thousand
dollars you expect to earn in salary.
 

           So I could be looking for a while.
 

           Not necessarily...
 

           Oh, don't sweat it. I'm pretty
confident about my plans.
 


           Oh yeah?
 

           Yeah. Can you tell me? Is high tide
in the morning or the evening?
 

           I don't know. Why?
 

           There's this beautiful bridge by my
apartment. I need to figure out
what time to jump off it.
 
          Natalie begins to tremble.
 



          Natalie bursts out the doors and sits on a bench. She's
freaked out. Ryan is five steps behind her. He puts a hand on
her shoulder.
 

           People say these things all the
time. It comes with the trade.
 

           They do?
 

           Sure. People are always saying
crazy stuff. They get worked up.
 

           She was so calm.
           53.



           (not quite sure)
I think that's a good sign.
 

           So they don't actually ever do it?
 

           No... it's just talk.
 

           How do you know? Do you follow up?
 

           I mean, no, nothing good can come
of that, but I don't think you
should worry about it.
 
          Natalie is clearly still worried.
 

           This is the job. Taking people at
their most fragile moment and
setting them adrift.
 













          Looking out the window at the passing landscape.
 
          Over the pastures and roads, we see GRAPHIC WHITE LINES AND
NUMBERS denoting each mile as they click by.
 
          Ryan tears a page out of AMERICAN WAY MAGAZINE outlining
their mileage program and hands it to Natalie.
 





          Ryan turns a corner to find Natalie talking to her computer
screen with headphones on.
           54.


          She's having an iChat with someone, but we only hear her side
of the conversation. Ryan decides to listen in for a second.
 

           I'll be back soon. Not really sure
how long this whole exercise is
supposed to last. He's fine... It's
hard for these guys to accept
change, you know.
(listens, rolls eyes)
I... I'm not even going to answer
that... No, I can't even think of
him that way... He's old.
 
          Ryan frowns. Checks a mirror.
 








          A 757 touches down on the runway.
 


          RYAN'S HEADSHOT - sitting on an EASLE.
 



          Ryan stands before a similar crowd as the opening of the film.
 

           Okay. This is where it gets a
little difficult, but stay with me.
You have a new backpack... but this
time, I want you to fill it with
people. Start with casual
acquaintances, people around the
office, friends of friends and work
your way to the people you trust
with your most intimate secrets.
Now move into family members -
cousins, aunts, and uncles. Get
your sisters and your brothers and
you parents. Get them all in that
backpack. And finally your husband
or wife or boyfriend or girlfriend.
Get them in their too.
           55.


          A titter through the crowd. For the first time, we see
Natalie near the side, watching.
 

           Don't worry. I'm not going to ask
you to light it on fire.
 
          Light laughter.
 

           Feel the weight of that bag. Make
no mistake, your relationships are
the heaviest components of your
life. Feel the straps cutting into
your shoulders. All those
negotiations and arguments and
secrets and compromises.
 
          Ryan lets the weight sink in.
 

           Now set that bag down.
 
          You can feel the relief in the room.
 

           You don't need to carry all that
weight.
 
          Noticeable agreement.
 

           Some animals were meant to carry
each other. To live symbiotically
over a lifetime. Star-crossed
lovers. Monogamous swans. We are
not one of those animals.
 
          Ryan focuses towards his conclusion.
 

           The slower we move, the faster we
die. We are not swans. We're
sharks.
 



          Ryan has finished his session and is talking to eager
stragglers. Ryan accepts a business card and elaborates on
one of his theories.
           56.


          Meanwhile, down the hall, Natalie is finishing a phone call.
She looks shell shocked. She closes her phone and pockets it
in silence.
 



          AN AMERICAN AIRLINES PLANE touches down.
 



          We're following a HILTON SHUTTLE down a street of PALM TREES.
 



          Natalie and Ryan ride back to the airport. We catch them mid-
conversation as Natalie drills Ryan on his theory.
 

           Never...?
 
          Ryan smiles to the few other riders as if apologizing.
 

           You never want to get married?
Never want kids?
 

           Is that so bizarre?
 

           Yes. Yes it is.
 

           I don't see the value.
 
          Natalie sighs.
 

           Sell it to me.
 

           What?
 

           Sell me marriage.
 

           I... Uh... How how about love?
 

           Pff...
           57.



           Okay. Stability?
 

           How many stabile marriages do you
know?
 

           Someone to talk to, spend your life
with?
 

           I'm surrounded by people to talk
to. I doubt that will change.
 
          The shuttle stops and everyone goes to grab their bags.
 



          Ryan and Natalie enter, still having the same conversation.
 

           How about just not dying alone?
 
          Ryan stops to address this.
 

           Starting when I was twelve, we
moved each one of my grandparents
into a nursing facility. My parents
went the same way.
                          (A BEAT)
           Make no mistake. We all die alone.
 
          Ryan turns, thinks of something, then turns back.
 


           Those cult members down in San
Diego with the white sneakers and
little Dixie cups of Kool-Aid. They
didn't die alone.
 
          Natalie looks steamed.
 

           Just saying - There's options.
 
          Out of nowhere, Natalie starts crying.
 


           Oh fuck.
           58.


          Natalie is now balling in the middle of the lobby.
 

           Brian left me.
 

           Oh, hey... I...
 
          Ryan goes to hug Natalie and she simply folds into his arms -
A mop of tears. Ryan looks around for a place to set her
down. Instead, he finds...
 
          ALEX - Who gives a questioning look to the young sobbing girl.
 

           Hi. Alex this is Natalie. Natalie,
this is my... friend, Alex.
 

           I should give you both a moment.
 
          Natalie attempts a recovery. It's not graceful.
 

           No, it's fine. I'm fine. Just
stupid emotions.
 
          Natalie gives Alex a firm handshake.
 

           Maybe a drink?
 
          Ryan goes to challenge the idea, when...
 

           Now we're talking.
 
          Natalie leads the way. Alex and Ryan exchange quick hellos.
 





          TEXT READS: "I Think it's time we c other people"
 



          The three share a booth. Natalie is sipping a drink. She seems
to have settled a little.
           59.



           He broke up with you over text
message?
 


           That's kind of like firing people
over the internet.
 
          Both Natalie and Alex shoot Ryan a look.
 

           (re: the ex-boyfriend)
What a weasely prick.
 

           Yeah, but what does that make me?
Someone who falls for a prick?
 

           We all fall for them. Pricks are
spontaneous, unpredictable, and
fun. And then we're surprised when
they turn out to be pricks.
 

           I followed him to Omaha.
 

           You did?
 

           I had a job waiting for me in San
Fran, when he got an offer from
ConAgra. He told me we could start
a life together. So I followed him.
 

           To Nebraska.
 

           I look in the mirror and I just see
compromise... I'm supposed to do
something.
 

           You'll do plenty.
 

           I just can't... I thought I'd be
engaged by now.
                          (CATCHES HERSELF)
           No offense.
           60.



          It's alright. None taken.
 

           When I was sixteen, I thought by
twenty three, I would be married,
maybe have a kid... Corner office
by day, entertaining at night. I
was supposed to be driving a Grand
Cherokee by now.
 

           Life can underwhelm you that way.
 

           Now I have my sights on twenty
nine, because thirty is just way
too... apocalyptic. I mean, where
did you think you'd be by...
 
          Natalie catches herself, having no idea how old Alex is.
 

           It doesn't work that way.
 

           At a certain point, you stop with
the deadlines.
 

           They can be a little counterproductive.
 

           I don't want to say anything
that's... anti-feminist. I mean, I
really appreciate everything your
generation did for me.
 

           (my generation?)
It was our pleasure.
 

           Well done.
 

           But sometimes it feels like no
matter how much success I have, it
all won't matter until I find the
right guy.
 

           You really thought this guy was the one.
           61.



           Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I
could have made it work. He just
really fit the bill.
 

           The bill?
 

           My type. You know, white collar.
College grad. Loves dogs. Likes funny
movies. Six foot one. Brown hair.
Kind eyes. Works in finance but is
Outdoorsy, you know, on the weekends.
(we think she's done)
I always imagined he'd have a
single syllable name like Matt or
John or... Dave. In a perfect
world, he drives a Four Runner and
the only thing he loves more than
me is his golden lab. Oh... and a
nice smile.
(back to Alex and Ryan)
How about you?
 
          This catches both Alex and Ryan off guard.
 

           I'm not sure if...
 

           I meant Alex...
 

           Right.
 

           Huh, let me think for a sec.
(mulls it over)
Well, by the time you're thirty four,
all the physical requirements are
pretty much out the window. I mean you
secretly prey he'll be taller than you.
 
          Ryan smiles.
 

           Not an asshole would be nice? Just
someone who enjoys my company. Comes
from a good family - You don't think
about that when you're younger.
                          (THINKING)
           Wants kids... Likes kids...
                          (MORE)



           Wants kids. Healthy enough to play
catch with his future son one day.
 
          We can tell Ryan is taking a serious interest in this.
 

           Please let him earn more than I do.
That doesn't make sense now, but
believe me, it will one day. Otherwise
it's just a recipe for disaster.
                          (REACHING)
           Hopefully some hair on his head...?
But it's not exactly a deal-breaker
anymore. Nice smile... Yep, a nice
smile just might do it.
 
          Alex looks to Ryan. He has a nice smile.
 

           Wow. That was depressing.
 
          Alex and Ryan react - It's not that bad.
 

           I should just date lesbians.
 

           Tried it. We're no picnic
ourselves.
 
          Natalie looks worse than when the conversation started.
 

           I don't mind being married to my
career, and I don't expect it to
hold me in bed as I fall asleep.
                          (LOOKS UP)
           I just don't want to settle.
 

           You're young. Right now you see
settling as some sort of failure.
 

           It is. By definition.
 

           Don't worry, by the time someone is
right for you, it won't feel like
settling... And the only person
left to judge you will be the
twenty four year old girl with a
target on your back.
           63.


          Natalie cracks a smile.
 
          Ryan looks to Alex. They've grown closer.
 



          Ryan, Alex, and Natalie wheel their ROLL-AWAYS towards the
elevator.
 

           So, what's the plan for this
evening?
 
          Ryan and Alex share an uncomfortable silence.
 

           What...? Oh, is it illicit?
 


           No...
 

           It's nothing like that.
 

           We are in Miami.
 

           ... We were going to hit that party
for the tech conference in the hotel.
 
          Natalie notices a group of SOFTWARE TYPES mingling with
badges around their necks.
 

           I didn't know you could just attend
those...
 

           Well, I mean...
 


           You're going to crash it?
 

          I mean, I don't know if... More money than they know
These guy put on a quite a what to do with...
party...
 

           No, I get it. I'm in!
           64.




          Ryan, Alex, and Natalie confidently walk up to the CHECK-IN
TABLE and take BADGES.
 
          They turn the corner. Alex reads Natalie's badge.
 

           Jennifer Chu?
 

           Oh shit!
 

           It's going to be fine.
 



          Corporate color balloons. Lots of guys in LOGO POLOS. That
great hip hop song from 1998 is playing over the PA.
 
          We find Ryan, Alex, and Natalie at a stand up table. They're now
wearing badges. Natalie is pretty tipsy at this point.
 


           You okay there?
 

           Oh yeah... This was a great idea.
                          (TO ALEX)
           You are so pretty. You're exactly what
I want to look like in fifteen years.
 

           Thank you, Natalie.
 
          A CONFERENCE LEADER steps up to an on stage MIC.
 

           How's everyone doing out there?!
 
          People cheer. So do Ryan, Alex, and particularly Natalie.
 

           I'm going to need you to all put
your hands together for a very
special guest - YOUNG... M... C!
 
          The opening beats of the 90's jam "Bust-A-Move" blast over
the speakers and sure enough, now-40-year-old rapper, Young
MC steps out and starts rapping.
           65.









          Everyone goes crazy and starts dancing.
 
          Ryan and Alex make it out to the dance floor. They're awful
dancers, but they're having fun.
 

           Think she'll be okay?
 

           Look...
 
          Natalie has already found a dancing partner, who can't
believe his luck. She's all over him. Ryan smiles.
 



          A nice two story yacht that was obviously purchased before
the bubble popped. Inside the galley, a group is playing
karaoke. NATALIE, wearing BADGES like Mardi Gras beads, is
singing "Time After Time".
 
          Meanwhile, near the back, Ryan and Alex sit with their legs
hanging off the back of the hull.
 

           Back home, I don't get to act the way
I do with you.
 

           That's why I don't have a "back home".
 

           I know. You're so cool. "Mr. Empty
Back Pack".
 
          Ryan emotionally stumbles.
 

           You know about the back pack?
 

           I googled you.
 

           You did?
           66.



          It's what us modern girls do when
we have a crush.
 

          Did it bother you?
 

          Well, that depends. Is the bag
empty because you hate people or
just the baggage they bring along?
 

          I don't hate people. I'm not
exactly a hermit.
 

          You just don't want to be tied down?
The whole responsibility thing.
 

          I don't think it's even that...
I... First time I ever flew, I was
sixteen.
 

          You're not going to answer? You're
just going to tell me a story?
 

           (smiles, continues story)
It was January and I had just
gotten my driver's license. The
lakes were frozen over, so we piled
into my car and hit the ice to do
donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit
a soft spot and the hood of my car
tilted up and I was sinking
backwards into the water.
 

          Jesus...
 

          I literally started to drown.
Within a few seconds, I black out.
Then, I wake up in the sky. I'm in a
helicopter, laying on a stretcher.
This guy in a uniform is telling me I
was minutes away from dying.
 

          Oh my God.
           67.



           Right?
(relives it for a second)
So just as we're hovering over the
hospital, I sit up. And from there,
I could see the whole western
horizon. We'd been flying twenty
minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a
city I'd thought of as remote,
halfway across the state... a
foreign capital.
                          (A BEAT)
           My parents had taught me we lived
in the best place on Earth, but now
I could see the world was really
just one place and comparing didn't
make much sense. And I remember
thinking - Don't tell me this isn't
an age of miracles. Don't tell me
we can't be everywhere at once.
 
          The idea settles in. Ryan returns to the point.
 

           I don't know what originally
sparked the back pack. I probably
needed to be alone. Recently, I've
been thinking that maybe I needed
to empty the bag before I knew what
to put back in.
 
          And now they kiss. It's notably different from their previous
kisses. Now, when they lock lips, we are reminded why people
kiss in the first place.
 
          Then, all of a sudden, the lights go out on the boat. The
motor has stopped. Ryan and Alex look back to find the
software dude stepping out of the galley, drunk.
 

           Hey... I think we're out of gas.
 
          Ryan and Alex look out to shore... about 500 yards away. For
whatever reason, they just start cracking up.
 



          Ryan and Alex are huddled under a blanket in the corner of
the rubber boat as it putters its way to shore.
 
          Cold, soaked, and smiling.
 
          Natalie and David are there too... still kissing.
           68.




          Everyone gets out of the boat in the cold knee deep water and
splashes up to shore.
 



          Ryan and Alex followed by Natalie and her make-out buddy,
soaked from the knee down, holding their shoes, scamper into
the hotel on the balls of their feet.
 



          Ryan's eyes flutter awake to see Alex getting dressed.
 

           Hey, you're up...
 

           Got to fly stand-by and make a
meeting in Milwaukee.
 


           Oh... Okay.
 

           (notices, teasing)
Oh, no. I made you feel cheap.
 

           Yeah, all right... Just leave the
money on the dresser.
 


           I'll text you later so we can swap
schedules.
 
          Alex gives him a peck. Ryan takes her wrist so she can't leave.
 

           I can't remember the last time I
enjoyed spending time with someone
as much as you.
 

           Neither can I.
 
          They kiss again and he lets go. Alex leaves and the door
closes. Ryan just lays in bed for a moment.
           69.




          Ryan and Natalie have a quiet breakfast. Natalie looks pretty
worse for wear.
 
          In the background is a TRAVELING SALESMAN rolling calls. He
perks up for each message then goes back to being miserable.
 
          Meanwhile, after a little silent eating...
 

           Last night got a little out of
hand. I said things... I don't
remember everything I said. I just
didn't want you to think...
 

           Just relax. It was nice to see you
cut loose. So, did you wake him up
or slip out?
 

           What?
 

           This morning... Your new friend.
Did you wake him for an awkward
good bye or just slip out so he
could feel like a whore.
 


           I... just left.
 

           Protocol is always tricky.
 

           I didn't know what was right.
 

           Sometimes there really is no right
thing to do.
 
          This doesn't comfort her.
 



          The walkway overlooks a large MARINA filled with giant
YACHTS. Ryan and Natalie are doing the photo thing with the
CUT OUT of the engagement portrait again.
           70.



          What happened to Alex?
 

          Had to skip town early to make a
meeting.
 

          That's too bad. Where does she live?
 

          Chicago.
 

          You thinking of going to see her?
 

          I don't know. We just don't have
that kind of relationship.
 

          What kind of relationship do you
have?
 

          It's, you know. Casual.
 

          Sounds pretty special.
 

          It works for us.
 

          Think there's any future there?
 

          Never thought about it. What's
going on here?
 

          Really never thought about it?
 

           (a good lie)
No.
 

          How can you not think about these
things? How does it not even cross
your mind that you might want to
have a future with somebody?
           71.



           It's simple, you know that moment
when you look into someone's eyes
and you feel them looking right
into your soul, and the whole world
goes quiet for a second.
 

           (finally, a break through)
Yes.
 

           Right. Well, I don't.
 

           You're an asshole.
 
          Natalie knocks over the CUT OUT and stands up.
 

           Oh come on, I'm just dicking
around. I need your help...
 

           Don't you think it's worth giving
her a chance?
 

           A chance to what?
 

           A chance at something real?
 

           Natalie, your definition of "real"
is going to evolve as you get
older...
 

           Would you stop condescending for
one second? Or is that one of the
principles of your bullshit
philosophy?
 

           Bullshit philosophy?
 

           The isolation? The traveling? Is
that supposed to be charming?
 

           No, it's simply a life choice.
           72.



           It's a cocoon of self-banishment.
 

           Wow. Big words.
 

           Screw you.
 

           Well, screw you too.
 

           You've set up a way of life that
basically makes it impossible for
you to make any human connections.
Now, somehow, this woman runs the
gauntlet of your ridiculous "life
choice" and comes out the other end
with a smile - Just so you can call
her casual. Jesus. I need to grow
up? You're a twelve year old.
 
          Natalie begins walking away.
 

           I don't have a gauntlet of...
 
          A GUST OF WIND suddenly blows the CUTOUT across the boardwalk
into the OCEAN.
 

           ... Fuck!
 
          Ryan goes running after the cutout. He climbs down a GANGWAY
to a dock that is closest to the CUTOUT, which is beginning
to sink in the filthy water.
 
          Ryan reaches... and reaches... and just as he's got a finger
tip on the photo... FALLS IN.
 



          Ryan, still damp from the ocean, is drying the CUTOUT with a
hair dryer.
 



          We're following the CUTOUT HEADS popping out of the ROLL-AWAY
like earlier, only now they are slightly faded and bent from
their trip in the harbor.
           73.






          We're watching Ryan through the window of the plane. He
almost looks trapped.
 



          The plane lands amidst snow.
 



          Ryan and Natalie drive in silence. The weather is frigid.
 

           These Detroit guys can be tough.
They've been getting hammered. Don't
get distracted. Stick to the simple
stuff. Get the packet in their hands
and get them out the door.
 



          A one story brick building. There's an inch of snow on the
ground. Ryan and Natalie enter the building in silence.
 



          Ryan and Natalie check in at the front desk.
 



          The door opens. Ryan and Natalie enter, when they both see
something and immediately stop short.
 
          Sitting on the conference table is a COMPUTER set up for a
          VIDEO CONFERENCE.

          Framed up in a WINDOW on the screen is CRAIG GREGORY.
 

           Welcome to Detroit.
 
          Natalie and Ryan exchange a look.
 

           What's going on here?
           74.



           I've been getting those great
numbers over the last few days.
Thought we should nut up and give
this a try.
 

           We could use a little more time.
 

           Gotta leave the nest at some point.
 

           This is a real company, Craig.
We're here to do some damage.
 

           I know. Good thing we brought our
best. So let's stop screwing
around, alright?
 

          Ryan sighs.
 

           Just give me a minute to prepare
and get my things together.
 

           I was thinking Natalie takes this one.
 
          Natalie, once confident, now takes pause.
 

           She's hardly ready for this.
 

           I've been watching her. She's great.
 

           (re: the webcam)
This is a whole other animal...
 

           I mean, she created it. Natalie,
you not up for it?
 

           I'm... I'm game.
 

           Atta girl.
           75.




          Ryan and Natalie have a moment aside.
 

           Just remember, don't apologize.
Don't tell them how hard this is
for you. Today is one of the worst
days they will ever have. What we
feel doesn't even compare.
 

           Got it.
 

           Just keep it professional. You're
going to do fine.
 



          Craig is leaning back in his office chair, watching Natalie
on his monitor.
 



          An unsuspecting man in his mid fifties enters the room and
takes a seat at a COMPUTER TERMINAL.
 
          (for the remainder of the scene, we will intercut between
Natalie's room and the POV of the man's iChat session.)
 

           Hello, Mr. Samuels. My name is
Natalie Keener.
 

           (checking out the PC)
What's going on here?
 

           I wish I was here with better news,
however your position here at
Deckers is no longer available.
 

           What are you talking about?
 

           You've been let go.
           76.



           What, just like that? I can't
believe... Who are you?
 

           My name is Miss Keener. I am here
to tell you about your options...
 

           I work here for seventeen years and
they send some fourth grader in here
to can me? What the fuck is this?!
 
          Ryan fights the urge to jump in. He is sitting next to
Natalie, but just out of view of the camera.
 

           It's perfectly normal to be upset.
However, the sooner you can tell
yourself that there are greater
opportunities waiting for you...
 

           Greater opportunities? I'm fifty-
seven-fucking years old!
 
          Mr. Samuels is now on the verge of tears. Eyes red.
 

           Anybody who ever built an empire,
or changed the world, sat where you
are now. And it's because they sat
there that they were able to do it.
 
          We remain in the room with Natalie and Ryan, but we hear Mr.
Samuels crying. It's loud and embarrassing. It's coming from
the next room. He's literally on the other side of the wall.
 

           There's a packet in front of you.
 
          Samuels picks up the packet and opens it.
 

           I want you to take some time and
review it.
 
          Samuels begins to leaf through.
 

           All the answers you're looking for
are inside those pages.
                          (MORE)



           The sooner you trust the process,
the sooner your next step in life
will unveil itself.
 
          Samuels puts down the packet. The tears still coming slowly.
 

           I need you to return to your office
now and begin to put together your
personal things.
 
          Samuels doesn't move. He's just sitting there in a daze.
 

           Thank you for your time, Mr. Samuels.
 
          No reaction. Just more silent tears. Natalie is getting nervous.
 

           Mr. Samuels? There's nothing else
we can discuss now.
                          (AND AGAIN)
           Thank you for your time.
 
          Ryan fights the urge to break in as Natalie continues to lose
her composure.
 
          Craig leans into his computer, watching intently.
 

           Mr. Samuels... Mr. Samuels.... MR.
           SAMUELS...

          Finally, Samuels breaks from his daze. He looks up and around
for a second, then gets up and leaves.
 
          Natalie catches her breath. A second later, Samuels passes
their room, visible through the conference room windows. They
watch as he walks away.
 

           You did good.
 
          Natalie nods.
 

           You okay? Want me to take over.
 

           No, I'm alright.
 
          Natalie pulls out a LIST OF FORTY NAMES. The amount of people
is daunting. She crosses off the first name.
           78.




          We find Natalie standing next to the rental car. She's staring
into a snow drift. Her eyes say everything - She just grew up.
 
          Meanwhile, Ryan is on his CELL. We catch the end of his
conversation with Craig.
 

           ... We just got out here. That was
one place. I think we need to try a
few more...
                          (LISTENS)
           Maybe there isn't a difference, but
it's comforting to know we're in
the next room.
                          (LISTENING)
           I know you don't give a shit about
my comfort.
                          (LISTENS)
           We could just use a little more
time. That's all I'm saying.
                          (LISTENS)
           Right... Right.
(shakes his head)
Yeah... Alright... Uh huh. Bye.
 
          Ryan hangs up.
 

           He thought you did a great job. You
did - I was real proud of you.
 

           Thanks.
 

           We're being pulled off the road.
                          (CLARIFYING)
           We're going home.
 

           For good?
 

           That's what it looks like.
 
          A moment of mixed emotions.
 



          Ryan is holding the LARGE EMBOSSED ENVELOPE of his sister's
          WEDDING INVITATION.



          He pulls out the RESPONSE CARD, looks at the line for extra
guests, then sets it down. He pulls out the actual
INVITATION. It looks inexpensive. Sighs.
 



          Ryan and Natalie ride the MOVING WALKWAY. Something is on
Natalie's mind. She speaks up.
 

           I'm sorry about what I said about
Alex. I was out of line.
 

           It's alright. I understand.
 

           I mean, who am I to be dolling out
relationship advice?
 

           It's fine.
 

           You going to be okay?
 

           What do you mean?
 

           In Omaha?
 

           Oh, I don't know.
 

           It's better than you'd think.
 
          They get off the moving walkway and stop at a GATE that reads
"Omaha". Something off screen grabs Ryan's attention.
 
          Ryan begins to walk off. Pulls out his BLACKBERRY and dials.
 

           Ryan, where are you going?
 

           Grabbing another flight... Something
I need to take care of. I'll see you
in, uh... at home.
 
          Ryan disappears in the crowd.
           80.




          We're looking at the LUXOR PYRAMID.
 

           Okay, start walking it in from the left.
 
          ALEX enters frame, carrying the engagement CUT OUT.
 

           I have to admit, when you asked me to
meet you in Vegas... I thought we'd
gamble, make out in a heart shaped
jacuzzi, maybe see one of those weird
French Canadian circus shows.
 

           There'll be plenty of time for all that.
(directing the photo)
One more foot to the left.
 
          Alex obliges. She checks out the engagement photo.
 

           How do you feel about the wedding?
 

           I'm fine, I guess.
(directing the photo)
Okay great... walk away.
 
          Ryan takes the photo.
 
          Alex picks up the engagement photo.
 

           They're a cute couple.
 

           Think so?
 

           Yeah, they'll make cute kids. If they're
lucky, maybe look a little like you.
 
          Alex and Ryan look at the photo together for a second.
 

           How do you like Wisconsin in February?
 

           Who doesn't?
                          (SWEETLY)




           I like it if you're there. Besides, I
know a killer burger in Milwaukee.
 

           Northern Wisconsin.
                          (CLARIFYING)
           What are you doing this weekend?
 
          This quickly registers... He's inviting me to the wedding.
 

           No...
 

           What? I haven't even...
 

           I can't.
 

           Why not?
 

           I couldn't.
 

           I'm being serious.
 

           You want me to be your date?
 

           Well... Yeah.
 

           To a wedding... Jesus, Ryan. Your
sister's wedding?
 

           It's not like I know her that well.
 

           I'm just not sure if it's
appropriate for me to...
 

           Look. You know. I'm not the wedding
type. But for the first time in my
life... I don't want to be that
guy, alone with his drink. I want a
dancing partner. I want a plus one.
And if you can stomach it, I'd like
it to be you.
           82.


          A long thoughtful beat. Alex sighs.
 

           Okay.
 

           Really?
 

           Yeah, I can't believe I... Yeah,
I'm in. When is it?
 

           I feel like we should kiss or
something.
 

           Then kiss me.
 
          They do.
 



          Two ROLL-AWAYS side-by-side, moving through the terminal.
 
          Ryan and Alex walk in unison. They share a smile. Almost like
they can't believe they're getting away with something.
 
          They pass a LARGE AIRLINE ADVERTISEMENT featuring MAYNARD
FINCH in uniform. "We Value Your Loyalty."
 



          Ryan's rental car pulls into the CHALET SUITES driveway. It's
halfway between a Swiss Lodge and a Best Western. Just a
little sadder. A yellow sign reads "Welcome Miller-Bingham
Wedding Guests!"
 



          Ryan and Alex approach the check-in lines. Of course, there's
an elite membership line, but they can't use it.
 
          Ryan is forced to stand in a queue of three people while a
CHECK-IN LADY just stands at her computer at the elite line.
 

           (to the CHECK-IN LADY)
Are you available?
           83.



           Sorry, this line is for members of
our Matterhorn program.
 
          Ryan steams.
 



          Ryan and Alex walk down the long hallway. They've been given
a room at the end. Just as they're entering their room, the
door across the hall opens revealing a woman in her early
forties with a basket of laundry. It's Ryan's sister KARA.
 

           Ryan?
 
          Ryan turns and stops. It's been a while...
 

           Kara...
 
          They hug. It's a strange hug. Awkward but heartfelt.
 

           Alex, this is my sister Kara.
 

           Well, hello.
 

           Hi.
 

           (quite frankly...)
Ryan has told me nothing about you.
 

           Kara, what are you doing at a hotel?
 

           Fuck, I was hoping I wouldn't have
to... Yeah, uh, Frank and I are
trying out a trial separation.
 

           You're not staying at the house?
 

           There was an extra room on hold
here, so I just took it for the
weekend.
           84.



           Oh, okay.
 

           Yup. So, you guys are dating?
 
          Ryan and Alex fumble over each other.
 

           Um...
 

           It's not exactly...
 

           Hey, don't worry about it. We're
all getting a little old to be
calling someone girlfriend... I
remember when mom used to call Jack
her boyfriend. It drove me up the
wall. Boyfriends are for kids...
                          (MOCK ANNOUNCING)
           And I'm just a divorcee!
 
          An awkward beat in the corridor of the Chalet Suites.
 

           So, the rehearsal dinner?
 

           Yeah, I'll see you two there.
 
          Kara humps the laundry basket down the hall.
 



          Ryan and Alex settle in. There's a cheap basket with a pink
ribbon tied sloppily around some cellophane. In the basket is
a packet, outlining the wedding weekend.
 

           There's a packet.
 

           What in life is worth doing that
doesn't have a packet.
 

           Um, I love you?
 
          Ryan is kidding, but not really. They play it off as a joke,
but can't help feel the weight of this "moment".
           85.




          A group of tables have been slid together for the rehearsal
dinner. Ryan and Alex find the dinner in full swing.
 
          Ryan's sister JULIE, the bride, waves wildly.
 

           Oh my God, Ryan!
 
          She hops up and gives him a hug.
 

           You must be Alex. You are so
beautiful. Kara was right. Did you
get the basket?
 

           The basket was very lovely.
 

           Tammy wrapped all of them.
 
          Tammy waves.
 

           Ryan, you look so grown up.
 

           Me? You're the one getting married.
 

           I know, right? You haven't even
seen my ring.
 
          Julie shows off her ring. It's not quite balanced and seems
to favor quantity over quality.
 


           Jim designed it.
 
          JIM raises a hand. This is Julie's husband-to-be and we can
tell immediately that Ryan isn't thrilled.
 
          Ryan thinks of something. He pulls out the 5X7 PHOTOS they
took of the JIM & JULIE CUT OUT.
 

           I brought those photos you were
asking for...
           86.




           Oh great! They go over there.
 
          Julie points to a table and Ryan walks over. When he gets there,
we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of America. It's
overwhelming. All of a sudden, his effort seems miniscule.
 
          Ryan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities
where they were taken. He backs away to see it as a whole and
his addition has already become invisible.
 
          Ryan returns to the conversation with his sister and Alex.
 

           There were quite a few already up
there. Almost couldn't find room.
 

           I know, isn't it great how everyone
chipped in?
 

           What gave you the idea to do
something so...
 


           ... Substantial?
 

           Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg
invested in this real estate
venture right now. So when we went
over our finances, a honeymoon just
didn't seem affordable this
second... So I thought... Hey, just
because we can't travel doesn't
mean we can't have pictures.
 
          The idea of this lands on Ryan pretty hard.
 

           It was a great idea.
 

           Thanks.
 






          Ryan is stuck with Jim, talking real estate. Alex is having a
chat with the brides maids about local relationship drama.
 

           It's sixty acres up against the
foothills. I subdivided the old
Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice
for myself.
 

           Sounds nice.
 
          Jim makes an exhale noise that means "you bet your ass".
 

           Homes will go in the high fours.
 

           Must be a nice development.
 


           It's a community, not a development.
The concept is turn-key everything.
You buy a maintenance contract with
the home. We'll whack your weeds,
we'll even change the light bulb.
Furniture? You buy your own or choose
a package. Seamless traditionalism,
yet all the perks.
 

           Nice.
 
          Ryan and Alex make eye contact. There's a joy in their
connection amongst the ramblings of their company.
 

           We all need a place to call our
own. This is America. This is what
we were promised.
 

           That's a nice touch.
 

           What?
 

           That bit at the end about
promise... I like it.
           88.



           (a little embarrassed)
Thanks.
                          (LEADING)
           So, you still renting that one-
bedroom?
 

           I gave it up.
 


           You own now?
 

           No.
 

           But you're looking?
 

           Not really. No.
 
          The conversation stalls out.
 



          Everyone is leaving. Tammy grabs Julie's hands.
 

           Can you believe it's tomorrow?! How
are you going to sleep?
 

           I don't know!
 

           You want some Xanax?
 

           I don't think that's for sleeping.
 

           No, I'm good. I'll have some warm
milk. That should do the trick.
 
          Jim comes walking by with a box of flower arrangements from
the tables inside that are going to be reused at the wedding.
 

           One more box...
           89.



           I'll get it.
 

           You sure?
 

           Yeah, yeah...
 
          Alex steps back in and for the first time in who knows how
many years, Ryan, Kara, and Julie are alone together.
 

           Jim seems like a good guy.
 

           Yeah, I know... Isn't he great?
 

           He's going to make a great husband.
 
          There's a moment where they just look at each other and
giggle a little. Just the three of them.
 

           Hey, Julie, I was thinking... with
dad not being... Well, I didn't
know if you had someone to walk you
down the aisle...
 

           Oh, yeah, Jim's uncle is going to
do it.
 


           He's been really supportive.
 

           Oh... Oh, great. Just wanted to
make sure you were covered. So I
should get there at...
 

           Guests are arriving around 5ish.
Things get going at 530. So you
know, around then. It's easy. Just
come down the elevator.
 
          Alex comes out with the second box. Ryan notices and grabs the
flowers from her and sets them in Jim's luxury pick-up truck.
           90.




          Ryan, Alex, and Kara arrive at their adjacent rooms. Key
cards slide in simultaneously. Alex heads in. Ryan stops.
 

           Hey Kara?
 

           Yeah.
 

           Can you believe she's getting
married already? She's just a kid.
 

           No Ryan. Actually, she's 37 years
old. She's barely squeaking by.
 

           Oh.
 

           Yup. Sleep tight.
 





          The rental car pulls up into the empty lot. Snow on the
ground. It's cold.
 
          Ryan and Alex walk up the steps and try the door of the main
building - it's locked. Ryan shrugs.
 

           That's all you got?
 
          Alex starts walking down the side of the building, looking
for an open window. The third one opens a crack. She slides
her HOTEL HONORS CARD in and opens the latch.
 

           Are we really doing this?
 

           Give me a boost.
           91.




          Alex slowly wedges herself headfirst through the window. Ryan
climbs in after her. He immediately recognizes his
surroundings.
 

           I took geography in here.
                          (POINTING)
           That was my seat.
 

           You ever fool around with one of
your teachers?
 

           No. You?
 

           Not until college. Come on, show me
around.
 
          They head for the door.
 



          A finger reaches and points to a teenage face.
 

           That's me.
 



          Ryan and Alex are huddled at the trophy case.
 

           You played basketball?
 

           Point guard. Don't act so surprised.
 

           I didn't know you were such a jock.
 



          Ryan and Alex walk passed a concrete ledge.
 

           My first fight.
           92.



           How'd it go?
 

           Got my ass kicked.
 



          Ryan shows an area behind the stairwell.
 

           This is where we used to go to make out.
 

           Very romantic.
 








          Alex and Ryan sit tight like teenagers on the team bench.
 

           I'm really happy I came here.
 
          The school soccer team takes the field for practice.
 

           (to the team)
Go Cougars!
 
          Players look back at him strangely.
 
          Ryan's phone rings.
 

           (checks caller ID)
It's Kara.
 
          The first thing we hear is crying in the background.
 





          Kara is on her cell phone. Behind her in the deep background,
we see bridesmaids consoling Julie.
           93.



           Ryan, where are you? We're having a
meltdown here.
 

           What's wrong? What happened?
 

           It's Jim. Can you get back here? We
need your help.
 

           Yeah, of course...
 



          Ryan's rental car pulls up in front. He hops out and Alex
takes the driver's seat.
 

           I'll grab your suit.
                          (ADDING)
           Good luck.
 



          Ryan immediately spots Julie sobbing and being consoled by
her bride's maids. The groomsmen are huddled in another
corner, embarrassed and confused. Kara splits from the brides
maids and takes Ryan aside.
 

           What happened?
 

           Jim's got cold feet.
 

           Today?
 

           That's how cold feet work.
 

           What do you want me to do?
 

           Talk to him.
 

           You want me to talk to him?
           94.



           Hey, it's either you or me. You know my
record. I've already struck out once.
 

           I haven't been to bat. I haven't
been in the dugout.
 

           Don't you talk for a living?
Motivational type stuff?
 

           I tell people how to avoid commitment.
 
          A beat.
 

           What kind of fucked up message is that?
 

           It's a philosophy.
 

           It's stupid.
 

           Hey, it might have helped you.
 
          A beat of stalemate.
 

           Come on, Ryan. You haven't been
around much. Fuck, you basically
don't exist to us. I know you want
to be there for her... Well here it
is. This is your chance.
 
          Ryan takes a breath.
 



          Ryan quietly steps in to find Jim, half dressed in a tux
reading the children's book "The Velveteen Rabbit". Jim
sniffles. Ryan goes to leave, when...
 

           Ryan?
 

           Oh, hey Jim.
           95.



           You ever read this?
 

           Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.
 

           I'll say.
 

           Kara mentioned you were having
some... thoughts?
 
          Jim puts down the book.
 

           I don't think I can do this.
 

           Okay. What makes you say that today?
 

           I was just laying there last night
in bed and I couldn't sleep. I was
thinking about the wedding and the
ceremony and all. Us buying a house
and moving in together. Having a
kid... Having another kid...
(begins to snowball)
... Thanksgiving, Christmas, spring
break, football games, all of a sudden
they're out of school, getting jobs,
getting married, And then, you know...
I'm a grandparent. I'm retired. Before
you know it - I'm dead... and I just
kept thinking... "What's the point?"
 
          Ryan gulps. Fuck.
 

           (now asking Ryan directly)
I mean what is the point?
 

           The point?
 

           Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here?
 


           It's marriage... it's the most
beautiful thing on Earth... you
know, what everyone aspires to...
           96.



           You never got married.
 

           That's true...
 

           You never even tried.
 

           Well, it's hard to define "try".
 

           You seem happier than most of my
married friends.
 
          Ryan takes a beat.
 

           Jim, I'm not going to lie. Marriage
can be a pain in the ass. And
you're kind of right - All of this
is just stuff on the way to your
eventual demise.
 








           We are all on running clocks that
cannot be slowed down or paused and
they all lead to the same place.
Some guys leave marks that last
beyond their own mortality. Not guys
like you and me... But some. But
even those footprints disappear.
                          (A BEAT)
           There isn't a "point".
 
          Jim sinks a little.
 

           I'm not the guy you'd normally want
to talk to about all this stuff...
But think about it - your favorite
memories. The greatest moments of
your life? Were you alone?
           97.



           (thinks about it)
No... I guess not.
 

           I don't want to sound like a
Hallmark card, but... Life? It's
better with company.
 
          Jim nods.
 

           Come to think of it... Last night,
the night before your wedding, when
all this shit was circling through
your head... Weren't you two
sleeping in separate rooms?
 

           Yeah, Julie went back to the
apartment and I was all alone in
that big honeymoon suite...
 
          Jim chuckles to himself.
 

           Kind of lonely?
 

           Yeah.
 

           Hey. Everybody needs a copilot.
 
          This resonates with Jim and he can't help but smile.
 

           That's a nice touch.
 

           Thanks.
 

           What's the mood like out there?
 

           It's not good... Emotional.
 

           What should I do?
 

           (twinkle in his eye)
Go get her.
           98.




          Jim walks over to the huddle of bride's maids. They part and
let him in. He kneels at Julie's feet...
 

           I'm sorry I'm such a fuck up...
Will you be my co-pilot?
 
          Julie gives him a perplexed look before smiling and falling
into his arms. Tears and smiles spread amongst the girls.
 
          Kara walks over to Ryan and pats him on the shoulder.
 

           Welcome home.
 


          - Ryan and Alex getting dressed in a little kitchen in the
church. They're in a hurry and a little sloppy, but there's a
crooked joy in their faces.
 
          - Jim standing at the alter with the priest getting a pat on
the back from his best man.
 
          - Julie getting walked to the alter by Jim's uncle. They pass
Ryan, who looks on proudly.
 
          - The priest gives his blessings.
 
          - Jim raises Julie's veil. They kiss.
 
          - Wedding attendees file into the Chalet Suites Banquet Hall.
 
          - Ryan and Alex mingle with their table.
 

           Hi, I'm Ryan.
 

           I'm your cousin... Harold.
 

           Oh, hey!
 
          - Ryan and Alex dance like teenagers.
 
          - The band does a cheesy choreographed dance step.
 
          - Jim makes a speech. He is not good at public speaking, but
the guests are generous with laughter.
 
          - Tammy has her tongue down a groomsmen's throat.
           99.


          - Ryan pulls Kara onto the dance floor. She rests her head on
his shoulder and they slow dance.
 
          - Jim and Julie make their farewell and run off.
 
          - Ryan and Alex help pick the center pieces off the tables.
 
          - Ryan and Alex get into the elevator together. She's wearing
his jacket. We're about to see them kiss, when the elevator
door closes.
 



          Ryan and Alex stand between their gates. One sign reads
OMAHA. The other sign reads CHICAGO.
 

           When am I going to see you?
 

           You're just going to have to come
and visit.
 

           So settled down. You're not going
to change on me...
 

           Same guy. Just one address.
 
          We hear a boarding announcement for Chicago. Alex begins to
step away to her gate.
 

           Call me if you get lonely.
 
          A beat. And then...
 

           ... I'm lonely.
 
          Alex turns for her gate and joins the crowd. Ryan goes to say
something. He has an impulse... but he finally ignores it and
gets in line under the sign that reads "OMAHA".
 





          The door opens and Ryan wheels in his Roll-Away. He walks over
to the window, parts the blinds and checks out his awful view.
           100.


          We see Ryan opening some mail. We see Ryan laying in bed.
 
          It's quiet. It's alone.
 



          Natalie is giving Ryan a tour of the new ONLINE FIRING AREA -
A series of cubicles with YOUNG GUYS ON HEADSETS. She is in
her element and very proud of her work.
 

           ... Some guy sits down in a
conference room somewhere and a
server routes their session to one
of our termination engineers.
 

           You don't actually call them that.
 

           I prefer "terminators", but it
bumped with legal.
 

           Really? I can't imagine why.
 

           They follow a workflow that can take
them through anything from a standard
dismissal to a violent aggressor.
 

           Are they actually on line, right now?
 

           No, they're beta-testing. Role-playing.
We go live at the end of the month.
(catches one of the guys
making a mistake)
Kyle, you're running through the
events too quickly. You have to give
them time to acknowledge each
statement. Okay? It's a legal thing.
 
          Ryan can only watch.
 



          Ryan is sitting at his desk. He puts on a HEADSET.
 

           This is ridiculous.
           101.




          Craig is leading a meeting. Ryan seems focused on something
on his laptop. We see his screen: An itinerary for GoalQuest.
 



          One of the GIANT DIGITAL MARQUEES reads: "GOALQUEST XX"
 



          Ryan sits on a sofa, holding his BACKPACK. A slick GOALQUEST
HOST enters the room.
 

           You ready to rock?
 
          Ryan nods and gets up.
 



          Ryan stands in the wings. He takes a breath, then steps out
in front of a sea of people.
 
          The GOALQUEST XX stage is like nothing we've seen yet. Large
and professional. Blue Banners hang from the ceiling. Digital
projectors show Ryan's Headshot - What's In Your Backpack?
 
          Ryan sets the BACK PACK on a table and quickly unzips it.
 
          A breath.
 

           Last year, I flew three hundred
fifty thousand miles. The moon is
only two fifty.
 
          A long beat. Uncomfortable. Ryan looks at the back pack.
 

           Imagine for a second that you're
carrying a backpack... I want you
to feel the straps on your
shoulders... You feel them?
 
          Ryan isn't feeling them. He is not inspired. He isn't
believable. He's barely even there.
           102.



           Now, I want you to pack it with all
the stuff you have in your life.
Start with the little things.
 
          Ryan is trying, but he can't find the will to do this.
 

           The... um... The stuff in drawers
and on shelves.
 
          Ryan takes a beat. He just stares at the backpack and thinks
about all the things he has removed from it... And then...
 

           Excuse me.
 
          And with that, Ryan leaves the stage. Handlers try to figure
out what Ryan is doing. The Host runs for the mic.
 


           What the fuck are you doing?
                          (TO CROWD)
           Okay, everyone just relax. We'll
have your next guest out in a sec.
 



          Ryan hustles past SLOT MACHINES until he is actually jogging.
 



          Ryan runs up to a gate. He's the last one to board.
 



          Over Ryan's shoulder, through the window, we see Chicago
below as the flight begins its descent.
 



          Ryan on the PEOPLE MOVER under the ceiling of NEON LIGHTS.
Peaceful music emits from hidden speakers. Ryan walks briskly
past idle riders.
           103.




          Ryan hurriedly signs a hand-held device, hops into a SEDAN
and speeds off. The RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT suddenly realizes...
 

           Hey, you forgot to give me your
Devotion Club card!
 



          Ryan steps out of his rental car and approaches the door of
the townhouse - checking the address against a piece of
          HILTON STATIONARY.

          Ryan stops, knocks, and puts on a smile.
 
          We hear Footsteps. The door unlocks and opens revealing ALEX.
She's wearing sweatpants and glasses. She's at home. She
looks different.
 

           Surprise.
 
          But there's something else. Alex is in shock... She's frozen.
 
          Something's wrong. Ryan's smile begins to melt.
 
          A man's voice calls from inside.
 

           Honey, who's at the door?
 
          A couple kids run by through the background, giggling. A man
chases after them.
 
          Alex is still speechless. Her eyes are angry and apologizing
all at the same time.
 
          Ryan just stands there. Emotionally bleeding to death.
 


           What are you doing here?
 
          Ryan begins to step away. He turns and heads for his car,
dropping the flowers.
 
          Alex's husband becomes visible just as she's shutting the door.
 

           Who was that?
           104.



           ... just some guy who was lost.
 
          Ryan gets in his rental car and drives off.
 



          We're watching Ryan through his window from far away... almost
as if looking through binoculars. He sits on his bed, tie
undone, holding a glass with an inch of scotch on his knee.
 



          We see quick glimpses of Ryan getting ready. Crappy little
COFFEE MAKER crappily brewing. Crappy hotel BAR OF SOAP
crappily lathering. Crappy HAIR DRYER crappily blowing.
 



          Ryan is on the phone with Alex.
 

           How could you lie to me?
 





          Alex sits in the car with the engine running.
 

           What were you thinking - Just
showing up at my door like that?
 

           What do you mean? I wanted to see
you. I didn't know you had a family
- Why didn't you tell me that?
 

           Come on, I thought we signed up for
the same thing.
 

           Try to help me understand. What is
it you signed up for?
 

           I thought our relationship was
perfectly clear. You're...
                          (MORE)



           (a long beat)
... an escape.
 

           I'm an escape?
 

           You know, a break from our normal
lives... A parenthesis.
 

           I'm a parenthesis?
 

           Seriously, Ryan? I can't believe
we're having this conversation. I
mean what do you want?
 
          Ryan stumbles on this. What does he want?
 

           You don't even know what you want.
I'm sorry that I ruined your night...
But you could have seriously screwed
things up for me. That was my family.
That's my real life.
 

           I thought I was a part of your real life.
 


           Look, Ryan. I'm a grown up. I don't
hold a grudge. When you're ready to
be an adult and see me again, just
give me a call.
 
          Ryan can't quite believe what he's hearing. There's only one
thing he can do. He hangs up.
 



          Ryan is walking when his phone buzzes. He checks the DISPLAY -
CTC Calling. He presses IGNORE.
 



          Ryan walks up to the TICKET DESK. He is more lost than usual.
There is something plucky about the TICKET AGENT.
 

           Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.
           106.



           Yeah, right, you got me in 2C?
 

           Of course. Left side aisle, non-
bulkhead. Just like you like it.
 

           What's got you so fucking happy?
 
          The plucky agent fades a bit, then tries to recompose.
 

           Your boarding card, Mr. Bingham.
 
          Ryan takes the ticket and exits.
 



          Ryan sits doing nothing. Others around him play Sudoku, read
trashy paperbacks, work on laptops. Ryan just stairs at the
stitching on the seat in front of him. When... "Bing"
 

           Ladies and gentlemen, we have a
special announcement to make.
 
          Passengers look up.
 

           Our pilot has just informed me that we
are passing over the city of Mesa...
which might not mean much to most of
you, but means a lot to one of our
fliers today, because he just hit
           TEN... MILLION... MILES...


           Oh no...
 
          The Gershwin theme song for the airline rains down from the
overhead speakers. Passengers clap. Flight attendants gather
at Ryan's seat with big smiles and champagne.
 
          Ryan doesn't even react. He's just stunned.
 
          The flight attendants separate just enough for a man in a
bomber jacket to squeeze through. It's Maynard Finch, the
Chief Pilot from the commercial.
 


           That seat taken?
           107.


          Maynard gives a little salute to his flight attendants, then
slides by Ryan to the window seat.
 

           You're the youngest yet to hit
twenty mil. Don't know where you
found the time...
                          (REMEMBERS)
           Oh right, here you go.
 
          Maynard pulls out a MEMBERSHIP CARD. It's actually been
stamped from platinum.
 

           Seventh card we've made. Small club.
We really appreciate your loyalty.
 
          It has a pair of wings around "Member Number 7". Ryan holds
it between his fingertips... Catches his own reflection.
 

           You know how many times I've
thought about this moment? Played
out the conversation I'd have with
you right here.
 

           Really? What did you want to say?
 
          A long beat.
 

           You know, I... I can't remember.
 

           That's alright. Happens to all of us.
(attempts chit chat)
So, where you from?
 
          Ryan looks at him straight in the face.
 

           I'm from here.
 



          Ryan picks up the phone at his desk. He removes his new TEN
MILLION MILE CARD and dials a number off the back.
 

           Hello, Mr. Bingham.
           108.



           Oh, how did you know it was me?
 

           This is your dedicated line. We
reserve them for our most loyal and
dedicated fliers.
 

           Oh. I'd like to transfer some of my
miles. Can you open up an account
under Jim and Julie Miller?
 

           Certainly. How many miles would you
like to transfer?
 

           How many miles would it take to
circle the globe?
 

           We have our "around-the-world" tickets.
They're five hundred thousand miles each.
 

           Sounds perfect.
 
          Craig enters Ryan's doorway.
 

           Got a second?
 

           (to the airline operator)
I'm going to have to call you right back.
 
          Craig takes a seat across from Ryan.
 

           What happened to you yesterday? I
was trying to reach you all day.
 

           I got tied up in... personal stuff.
What's going on?
 
          An uncomfortable beat.
 

           Do you remember Karen Barnes?
 
          Ryan doesn't.
           109.



           She was part of a thirty person
reduction a few weeks back in
Wichita. Natalie fired her.
 

           No, I fire dozens of people a day.
 

           She killed herself. Jumped off a bridge.
 

           Fuck.
 


           Yeah.
                          (FORMALITY)
           Do you remember anyone giving you any
signals of anything? Depression?
 

           They're all depressed. We're firing them.
 

           Hey, look, you know I have to ask.
 

           No, I don't remember anything. Of
course they're upset. You never
think that...
 

           Wasn't any woman who gave you any
indication...? Anything?
 
          Ryan remembers her.
 

           No, nothing that stands out.
                          (A THOUGHT)
           Is Natalie alright? Is she coming in?
 

           Natalie quit.
 
          Ryan isn't surprised.
 

           Just like that?
 

           Text message.
           110.


          Ryan stifles a laugh.
 

           Yeah, real fucking nice, right? No
one has manners anymore.
 

           She say where she was going?
 

           Nah. She was pretty upset.
 

           I should give her a call.
 


           I need you back in the air.
 
          Ryan doesn't react.
 

           Did you hear me? I thought you'd be
thrilled.
 

           I'm fine. What about video conferencing?
 

           CTC is pausing on the whole new media
front for a moment. Giving it a little
more thought. Getting our work horses
back out doing what they do best.
 

           How long are you sending me out?
 

           We're going to let you sail and
sail. Send us a postcard if you
ever get there.
 
          Ryan absorbs this. Nods.
 



          A MANAGEMENT LEVEL GUY sits at his desk. Bay Area sports
paraphernalia on the wall.
 

           So, what happened?
 
          We turn to reveal Natalie.
           111.



           How exactly do you mean?
 

           You graduated top of your class.
You seemed to have your pick of
employment... Including right here.
Instead, you went to Omaha... to
fire people for a living.
 


           It's challenging work.
 

           I can't imagine doing that day-in-
day-out. Not in this climate.
 

           (after a beat)
... I followed a boy.
 
          The manager smiles to himself.
 

           Everybody does at one point or
another.
 
          The manager raises a letter - It's Ryan's letter.
 

           This guy says I'd be lucky to have
you.
 



          Ryan writing the letter. We hear what he's writing...
 

           To whom it may concern, I can't even
count the number of people I've fired
in my lifetime. So many, that I've
forgotten what it's like to actually
hire somebody. We've never met, but I
know you'd be lucky to have Natalie
Keener. My advice? Take her and don't
look back. She'll be the best
decision you've made in a long time.
 





          The manager puts down the letter and reaches out a hand.
 

           Hope he's right.
 
          Natalie breaks into a smile, then jumps back to professional.
 



          Ryan steps out his front door, ROLL-AWAY in tow.
 



          Ryan walks through the automated door. He looks like he did
in the opening of the film. Maybe even wearing the same
clothes. Something is different though.
 

           Tonight, most people will be
welcomed home by jumping dogs and
squealing kids. Their spouses will
ask about their day and tonight
they'll sleep.
 
          Ryan stops and looks up at a GIANT BOARD OF DESTINATIONS. An
endless list of cities around the world. A menu of new lives
departing every five minutes.
 

           The stars will wheel forth from their
daytime hiding places.
 
          We look back at Ryan. His eyes lock on one of the cities. We
don't see which one. He makes a mental decision and turns in
the direction of the gate. He lets go of his ROLL-AWAY.
 

           And one of those lights, slightly
brighter than the rest, will be my
wingtip, passing over, blessing them.
 
          Ryan takes a step, but before his foot can land we...
