We span the 
whole length of this Ivory Tower. It is said to be as big as a city. We 
pass over the base of the tower, then its mid section, and finally we 
near the very top of the structure. It is very intricate here. We begin to 
zoom in on the Magnolia pavilion. The very tip of the Ivory Tower, the 
place that the Empress lives.
The Empress had already sent for the great 
warrior. When he finally

WIDE VIEW: 
Atreyu climbs up the muddy mountain and calls 
for Morla several times. The mountain starts 
moving and he grabs a tree branch. The branch breaks and he slides down 
the mountain, hurting his shoulder. He lands in the swamp ground below and 
turns and crawls away to a tree nearby that faces the mountain. He climbs 
it and sees a giant turtle head coming out of the mountain. Bastian 
screams and Atreyu and Morla look around. 

Bastian sits up 
SURPRISED.
Bastian:
But that's impossible, they 
couldn't have heard me.

Atreyu:
Are you Morla, the ancient 
one?

Morla:
Not that it matters but 
yes.

Atreyu:
Please help me Morla. Do you 
recognize this?

 

Well, we haven't seen the 
Auryn in a long time.

Atreyu:
We ? (he looks around) Is 
there someone else here too?

Morla:
We haven't spoken to anyone 
else for thousands of years,
so we started talking to 
ourselves. 

(she sneezes and blows 
Atreyu out of the tree.)

Atreyu:
Morla, I bring terrible 
news. Did you know that
the Empress is very 
ill?

 

Not that it matters, but 
yes. Actually we don't care.

 

If I don't save her, she'll 
die! There's a terrible nothing
sweeping over the land. 
Don't you care about that? ! 

 

We don't even care whether 
on not we care.

 

Do you have a 
cold?

Morla:
No, we're allergic to 
youth.

Atreyu:
You know how I can help the Empress don't 
you?

Morla:
Not that it matters, but 
yes.

 

If you don't tell me and the nothing keeps 
coming,
you'll die to! Both of you! 

 

Morla:
Die ? That at least would be 
something.

She starts to sneeze 
again, but doesn't so Atreyu relaxes his grip 
on the tree. Unknowing 
that she can sneeze at any moment.

 

Please tell me. You said you knew the 
answer.
 

She sneezes and blows 
him out of the tree. She becomes agitated.

 

We're tired of sneezing, go away. Nothing 
matters.

 

(He climbs back up the 
tree)

That's not true.
If it didn't really matter to you then you'd 
tell me.

 

 


Atreyu:
 


 

We don't know, but you can ask the Southern 
Oracle.

Atreyu:
 How 
can I get there? 

 

You can't . It's ten thousand miles 
away.

 

 


 

 That's 
right. Forget it. Good night.


CUT TO: School 
hallway

The school bell rings and Bastian sits up with 
a start. The school day 
Has ended and everyone is leaving. Bastian 
walks out as the lights turn off. 
The attic is spooky, it is dark and stormy. 
Bastian grabs his 
stuff and runs out of the attic, but then comes 
back, shaking his head.

 

 


He starts back towards the mat, but lightning 
followed by a loud clap of thunder 
Startles Bastian prompting him to leap 
backwards. A wolf head from an old school festival falls down in front of 
him and he screams in terror.

CUT TO: 
Swamps

View of Atreyu stumbling, exhausted through the 
swamp. He falls several 
times and has to stop for rest. His shoulder 
really hurts him. Atreyu stumbles 
into a puddle up to his neck and we see the 
wolf running after him. As Atreyu 
starts to faint he looks up and sees a dragon 
coming towards him from high in
the sky. The wolf reaches him right 
as the dragon picks him up. The wolf 
howls in anger as he misses the boy. 


END 
SCENE:

FADE IN: Attic- 
Bastian

Bastian flops down on his back and sighs. 
Relieved that Atreyu 
escaped the Gmork and the swamps, but what was 
that creature 
that saved him? Bastian sits back up and starts 
reading again. 

 

After days and nights of unconsciousness, 
Atreyu slowly 
opened his eyes and found himself in strange 
surroundings. 
He was clean and his wounds were 
dressed.

VIEW: - Atreyu waking 
up. His is asleep behind the arm of 
the dog-like dragon. He lifts it's arm so he 
can get away. 
The dragon opens one eye, then closes 
it.

 

Shew.

 

The dragon wakes up as Atreyu runs 
away.
Leaving so soon, hmm? 

 

Uh, I was just going..... I have to 
......
I was trying to ... (he 
stutters.)

 

 


Atreyu:
Yea..... I mean no. 
No!

 

I like 
children.

 

For breakfast? 


 

Never ! I'm a luck dragon. 
My name is Falkor.

 

And my name 
is..

 

Atreyu. And you're on a 
quest.

 

How'd you know 
that?

 

You were unconscious and you 
talked in your sleep.

Atreyu:
Wha? 

 

(Falkor starts straining to 
reach his ear, but his leg is to short.)
Could you get round and 
scratch behind my right ear? 

 

I can never quite reach 
it.

 

(Atreyu starts scratching a 
spot.) Here? 

 

Oh yea. Huh huh huh, oh. 
That's so good. Thank you.

 

So little fella, you're on 
you're way to the Southern Oracle?

 

Yes, but it's hopeless. It's 
too far away!

 

Oh, I wouldn't necessarily 
say that.

 

Do you know how to get 
there?

 

Why sure, it's right around 
the corner.

 

How'd all this 
happen?!


 

Falkor:
With luck 
!

 

You've already brought me 
the entire Ten thousand miles?

 

No, only nine thousand eight 
hundred and ninety one,
as the dragon 
flies.

 

You're amazing! 


 

 


 


 
       style="mso-spacerun: yes">Good 
luck will find you.

 

It's good to have a friend 
again.

 

You have more than one. 
Look. 

(motioning behind 
Atreyu.)


Atreyu goes to a small entrance and bends down 
to look in. 
A tiny old man sits writing in a book and an 
old lady comes 
in humming a tune. She throws some worms into a 
pot and 
stops to eat one. Atreyu closes his eyes 
disgusted. 
Atreyu smile as they start fighting. 
 

Get out of my light wench. 
You're disturbing my scientific work.

 

You and your scientific 
work. What the boy needs now is one of my potions.

 

The boy will need my 
scientific advice much more.

 

Yes, yes, but not until he's well. Get back to 
your own place. 
I'm always finding you in my place! 


 

I'm 
going.

Atreyu clears his throat to get their 
attention

 

He's well! Now it's my turn 
with him.


 

Oh no you don't! I decide when he's 
well.
It's your turn when I say it's your 
turn.

VIEW -She gets a cup 
full of the mixture in the pot and comes to stand in front of 
him.

Urgl:
Well, little man, still in pain 
?

He puts a hand on his shoulder as he speaks to 
her. Testing the bandage.

 

 


 

I like that. The patient telling the doctor 
it's all right.
It has to hurt if it's to 
heal.

(She stops and sniffs the cup then holds it out 
to him.)

Here. Drink that.

 (He 
takes it from her and starts drinking.)

 

Good, huh? That's my batwing broth. There's eye 
of newt
in there, tree mold, old lizard brains, scales 
from a
rancid sea serpent.

Atreyu looks at the cup like he's sick. The old 
man stands and speaks to him.

 

Just where did you and your dragon come 
from?
What are you onto? Anything of interest to 
the
scientific community? 

 

My name's Atreyu. I came here to find the 
Southern Oracle.

 

Oh, you've come to the right place my 
boy.

 

 


 

I am somewhat of an expert on the Southern 
Oracle.

 

 

 (she 
mocks Engywook)

 

 


 

 

Why don't you sit down and be quiet for once 
?!

 

You keep quiet wench.

 

Oh !

 

It's now my 
turn.

 

My 
name is Engywook. Uh, she's Urgl. Ever heard of me? 

 

I don't think so.

 

You don't move in scientific 
circles.


Atreyu smiled 
apologetically and shook his head no. 

 

I am the expert on the Southern 
Oracle.
Oh you've come to the right place my 
boy.

 

There's no fool like an old 
fool.

 

Wait. Stay here. To the 
observatory. he says stopping her.
To the winch ,wench 
!

CUT TO: 

View of Urgl turning a handle of a large 
machine that pulls a 
Basket carrying Engywook to the top of a high 
ledge on one 
of the surrounding rocks. Atreyu follows him on 
the ground.
 


Engywook:
Come on lazy bones, can't you go any faster 
?

I've been studying the mystery of the Southern 
Oracle for
years, someday I'll publish my book : A Century 
of Studying
The Southern Oracle by Professor Engywook, 
volume one
The Early Years.

Atreyu:
Have you ever been to the Southern Oracle 
?

 

Well, what do you think? I work 
scientifically.

As Atreyu pulls himself up on the ledge he sees 
2 great sphinx-like statues. 
The man looks into a improvised sort of 
telescope and then tells Atreyu to do the same.

 

Is that the Southern Oracle 
?

 

Well, no. It's the first of 
the 2 gates you must pass through
before you reach the 
Southern Oracle and get me the final
information for my book. Of 
course, most people never get
that 
far.

Atreyu:
Why?

 

The sphinx's eyes stay 
closed until someone who does
not feel his own worth tries 
to pass by. Ah !
Here comes one that looks 
fancy.

VIEW of a man in fancy 
armor approaching the gate.

 

Let's see what he really thinks of 
himself

(Atreyu watches through the 
telescope.
The man starts to 
hesitate.)

Go on scaredy cat. Oh, go 
on!

 

Oh, it's my turn, let me 
see.

(Atreyu ignores 
him.)

I'm the 
scientist.

 

He's going on. I think he's 
gonna make it.

 

 
       style="mso-tab-count: 1"> 

!

 

They're 
shut.

(he looks back and forth 
between them.)

No wait ! The eyes are open 
! 

Rays of pure light shoot out of the sphinx's 
eyes and zap the man. Atreyu looks up, shocked at the sight he had 
seen.
 

Oh no! Did he make it ? Did 
he?
 

Atreyu:
(Atreyu shakes his head.) 
No.
 

Fancy armor doesn't help much. The sphinxes can 
see
straight into your heart. Listen boy, next time 
let me see
what happens ! It's my 
telescope.

 

(Atreyu sets his jaw 
determinedly.) I'm gonna try it.
 

Atreyu starts climbing down as Engywook calls 
after him

 

No ! Don't go yet. I haven't told you about the 
next gate.
It's even worse than this one. Atreyu ! Atreyu 
!

Atreyu continues on and approaches the gate. As 
he walks up the eyes stay closed.

 

He'll never make it. He'll never make 
it.

Atreyu does fine until he sees the fallen man, 
who is just a charred skeleton. He panics and starts looking back and 
forth between the 2 sphinxes. 

 

(The old man cries out.)
Don't start to doubt yourself now ,be confident 
! 

 

(Bastian cries out )
Be confident , be 
confident.

The eyes open and Bastian cries 
out.
 

Run Atreyu run 
!

 

Run Atreyu 
!

Atreyu looks straight ahead and Bastian calls 
out.

 

Run now! 


Atreyu runs through the gate and just barely 
makes it. He turns and looks back, then sighs.

Engywook is so happy he jumps in the basket and 
falls out when he gets back to where Falkor and Urgl 
are.
 

He made it ,he made it 
!
 

View: Urgl is giving 
Falkor a shot. 
 

You could do with a dose of juicy vitamins 
too.

 

He made it, Atreyu, he made it through the 
sphinx gate.
I always said he could do 
it.
 

Oh good ! But that's no reason for 
you to go falling out of the Basket again?

Engywook:
Oh 
hogwash!

 

I knew he would be 
safe.

 

Nonsense ! You don't 
understand anything!
The worst one is coming 
up.
Next is the Magic Mirror 
gate.
Atreyu has to face his true 
self.

 

So what ? That won't be too 
hard for him.

 

Oh ! That's what everyone 
thinks. But kind people
find that they are cruel, 
brave men discover that
they are really cowards. 
Confronted with their true
selves most men run away 
screaming !
VIEW: 

of Atreyu in a blizzard. He approaches the 
Mirror gate and looks into it.
After a while, he sees Bastian 
reading the story. Bastian looks up then 
throws the book across the 
room.
 

No. This is going too 
far.

(He pauses and looks at the 
book.)

What if they really do know 
about me in Fantasia?

(He picks the book back 
up.)


VIEW: 

of Atreyu. He sticks his hand through the 
Mirror and then pulls it back out. 
Then he walks through the 
gate.
 

(Bastian lights a 
candle)
The Southern 
Oracle?

Atreyu approaches another two sphinxes. As he 
approaches they start speaking to him.

 

 

 

Atreyu.

(they speak in unison.)

 

Are you the Southern 
Oracle?


 

Yes, we 
are.

 

Then you must know what can 
save Fantasia !

 

Yes we 
do.

 

Well, what is it ? I have to 
know.

 

The Empress needs.... a new 
name.

 

A new name. Is that all ? 
But that's easy ! 
I can give her any name she 
wants.

 

No one from Fantasia can do 
it, only a human child.

 

A human child ? Where can I 
find one?

 

They can only be reached 
beyond the boundaries
of Fantasia. You must hurry 
Atreyu. We do not
know how much longer we can 
withstand the nothing.

(The sphinxes start crumbling. Atreyu runs away 
calling for Falkor.)

VIEW - Falkor with 
Atreyu on his back. They are flying over Fantasia.

 

Hurry Falkor, the nothing's 
everywhere.

 

Don't worry. We'll reach the boundaries of 
Fantasia.

 

Do you know where they are 
?

 

I have no 
idea.

 

Then how are we supposed to 
find them?

 

With 
luck.

 

Faster Falkor, 
faster.

All right ! Hang on 
tight!

Falkor carrying Atreyu over many different 
lands of Fantasia. 
A beautiful display of landscapes play over the 
screen then we

CUT TO- Attic window  
CLOSE UP of Bastian.


 

What a shame they don't ask me. My 
mother,
she had such a wonderful 
name.

He closes the window and goes back to reading 
the book.

On and on they flew until they reached 
the
Sea of Possibilities where they could go no 
further.

VIEW of Falkor and 
Atreyu. The sky is gray and is incredibly windy. 
Great storm clouds can be seen all around 
churning and expanding.
It is the Nothing, the force destroying 
fantasia, and Falkor and Atreyu
Have ended up right in the center of part of 
it.

 

Look Atreyu, the 
nothing.

Falkor is tossed around in all directions, 
Atreyu tries to hold on as best as he can. The wind blows wilder and 
wilder until finally it tosses Falkor onto his back, and knocks his 
passenger into the air. Atreyu falls, but Falkor cannot get to him before 
he disappears into the chaos below.

CUT TO- 
Attic

The window bursts open and Bastian climbs up 
and closes it. Against a torrent of rain and wind. Finally he gets the 
window closed and he looks down at the book, he is soaked, and a bit 
winded at his experience. Then he remembers the story 
hero.

FADE TO- 

View of Atreyu on a lying on a beach. Atreyu 
wakes with a start, 
and discovers that the Auryn is gone. He stands 
up and looks at
the sky, searching frantically for 
his friend Falkor, but Falkor is 
not there. 

 

Falkor !Falkor !Where are 
you? Falkor !

Somewhere in the heavens 
Falkor is searching for Atreyu.

 

View of Falkor calling for Atreyu." Atreyu ! 
Atreyu !
 

Atreyu:
Falkor !

Atreyu reluctantly gives up on calling Falkor. 
He turns his eyes 
to the beach, he finds a trail of foot prints 
in the sand, but they were not his, 
but that of a large beast. Atreyu follows them 
and Finds himself following a 
path to a city that has seen better days.On his 
way he stopps to rest leaning 
against the remains of what seems like a stone 
wall, but he soon finds that it 
was not a wall at all, but a Rockbiter. The 
giant looks down at atreyu and holds
out his 
hands.

 

They look like big, good, 
strong hands. Don't they?

 

 

 

friends.
 The little 
man with his racing snail, the Nighthob, even
 the stupid bat. I 
couldn't hold on to them. The nothing
pulled them right out of my hands. I failed. 


Atreyu looks down, feeling terrible. 

 

No you didn't fail. I'm the 
one who was chosen to stop the nothing.
But I lost the Auryn, I 
can't find my luck dragon, so I won't be able
to get past the boundaries 
of Fantasia.

 

Listen, the nothing will be 
here any minute.
I will just sit here and let 
it take me away too.
They look like big, good, 
strong hands. Don't they?

Rockbiter starts crying as Atreyu shakes his 
head yes and fights his own tears. 
He continues along the trail again, and finds 
himself in a different part of the city. 
Ahead of him is a larce mostly intact building, 
Atreyu dodges falling rocks and 
enters an opening. 

On the walls are paintings of everything that's 
happened during his Quest. 
The Empress giving the Auryn to Carion, Carion 
giving the Auryn to Atreyu,
Atreyu trying to save Artax in the 
Swamps of Sadness, Morla, and Falkor, 
and more.

As Atreyu turns a corner he sees a painting of 
a wolf, then he turns another
corner and sees the wolf hiding in 
a smaller opening. It growls wildly at Atreyu 
as he approaches

 

Gmork:
If you come any closer I 
will rip you to shreds.

Atreyu squats down where he's at and looks at 
the wolf. 

 

Who are 
you?

 

I am G'mork. And you, 
whoever you are,
can have the honor of being 
my last victim.

 

I will not die easily. I am 
a warrior.

 

(G'mork laughs.) Brave 
warrior, then fight the nothing.

 

But I can't ! I can't get 
beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.

G'mork laughs and Atreyu grows 
angry.
 

What's so funny about that 
?

 

Fantasia has no 
boundaries.

A storm grows closer to the city, slowly 
shaking it to pieces
Rocks fall here and 
there.
 

That's not true. You're 
lying.

 

Foolish boy. Don't you know 
anything about Fantasia?
It's the world of human 
fantasy. Every part ,every
creature of it, is a piece 
of the dreams and hopes of mankind.
Therefor, it has no 
boundaries.

There's a crash and more rocks 
fall.
 

Atreyu:
But why is Fantasia dying 
then ?

 

Because people have begun to loose their 
hopes
and forget their dreams. So the nothing grows 
stronger.

 

What is the nothing 
?!

 

It's the emptiness that's 
left. It's like a despair,
destroying this world. And I 
have been trying to help it.


 

But why 
?

 

Because people who have no 
hopes are easy to control.
And whoever has control has 
the power.

A large crash shakes the ground. Atreyu loses 
his balance for a moment, 
but quickly regains it and turns back to the 
wolf. He gives him a cold look 
then asks him, 
 

Who are you really 
?

 

I am the servant of the 
power behind the nothing.
I was sent to kill the only 
one who could have
stopped the nothing. I lost 
him in the Swamps of
Sadness. His name was 
Atreyu.

The ground shakes and Atreyu falls over 
backward. He grabs a long, sharp 
piece of broken stone and stands up. He then 
yells at G'mork.

 

If we're about to die 
anyway, I'd rather die fighting.
Come for me G'mork ! I am 
Atreyu!

G'mork growls and jumps at him. Atreyu plunges 
the sharp rock into the beasts 
heart, killing the Gmork. As Atreyu pulls 
himself from the carcass of the Gmork,
Atreyu finds that the beast managed 
to inflict a wound on Atreyu. He stands and
winces at the deep gash across his 
chest. Another crash echoes through the 
ruins as Atreyu makes his way out of the 
ruins.

CUT TO- Ocean Falkor 
under water

Falkor dived deep into the Sea following a 
slight ray of light from beneath the 
waves. As he swims deeper and deeper more and 
more bubbles form around
his body, finally he reaches a coral reef, and 
finds that the ray of light was 
coming from the lost necklace. Falkor opens his 
mouth, and plucks the Auryn
from the coral with his 
teeth.

Driven by a will much like his own he headed 
straight for the abandoned city. 
Below him he could barely make out the form of 
Atryeu leaving a collapsing 
building.

Atreyu comes out of an opening and latches onto 
a tree as the Nothing consumes 
more and more the surrounding land. Atreyu 
calls out for Falkor and this time Falkor 
calls back.

 Atreyu, hang 
on!

Atreyu holds tight to the tree as strong winds 
threaten to rip him from the branches. 
Almost as he was losing his grip Falkor plucked 
him out of the tree, and headed for
safer skies. But that was all there 
was left, below them the Nothing enveloped the remaining pieces of land. 
Fantasia was gone.

Falkor flies through a belt of fragments still 
remaining after the Nothing. 
The sky is graveyard of left over pieces of 
Fantasia. Atreyu wakes from 
his exhaustion and looks around with a heavy 
heart.

 

Good old Falkor, can you see 
anything ? Anything at all ?

 

No, all the land is 
gone.

 

I know, and all because I 
failed.

 

You 
tried.

 

Do you suppose the Ivory 
Tower is still standing? 

 

Let's hope so, Atreyu. Let's 
hope so.

Atreyu looks down at the amulet dangling from 
his neck, and gets an idea
that might just help 
them.

 

Let the Auryn guide 
you.

(He clutches the medallion with his hands 
)

If the Ivory Tower still stands take us 
there.

him. Before him was the Childlike Empress in person. She sits silently on

My horse died, I nearly drowned, and I 
just
barely got away from the nothing. 
For what ?! 
To find out what you already knew 
?!

 

 

Earthling.

 

 


  

 


Bastian sits up slowly as we hear what she's 
saying.

 

 


 


 

 

Atreyu looks around, as does she.

Two fragments of Fantasia collide and explode 
shaking the Tower Violently.

doesn't he arrive ?!

from the boys in the 
bookstore.

 

 But that's 
impossible!

 

They were with him when he took the 
book with the 
Auryn symbol on the cover, in which he's 
reading his 
own story right now.

 
       style="mso-tab-count: 1"> 


I can't believe it, they can't be talking about 
me.

The Ivory Tower cracks. Atreyu turns around to 

see where it cracked, then he turns back to the 

Empress.

 

What will happen if he doesn't 
appear?!

 

 
       style="mso-tab-count: 1">

The Ivory Tower shakes and cracks some more. 
Atreyu falls over backward 
and is knocked 
unconscious.

EXT. 
VIEW-
the courtyard is being taken away by the 
Nothing. Because of Bastians new 
found disbelief the Nothing has grown stronger 
and is now attacking the last remaining part of 
Fantasia.

He climbs up to the window and opens it. He 
leans out into the storm and calls out the name he had chosen for her. 


 

 


NEXT 
SCENE-
Darkness, pure and black as night. We hear 
Bastian speak.

A small light appears and starts growing until 
the two childs faces are
illuminated. It is coming from an 
object in Moonchild's hand. Bastian looks at it.

       style="mso-spacerun: yes">Open

She puts the grain into his hand and he looks 
at it.

Moonchild follows his 
gaze and smiles.

CUT TO- Bastian riding 
Falkor

 



 

 
       style="mso-spacerun: yes">Falkor, 
it's even more beautiful 
 


 

 


 

 


 


 

like the nothing never was.

They fly over Rockbiter, the Nighthob, and the 
little man. Bastian waves 
to them and Rockbiter waves back. They change 
their direction and suddenly below them is a great endless field, the 
Great Plains. Bastian looks down and sees a familiar face from his 
imagination, only now its real.

home.

 

 
       style="mso-spacerun: yes">What 
would you like to wish for next?

Bastian leans over and whispers in his ear. 
Falkor laughs.

CUT TO- 
View of the three bullies talking out on the 
street where they had chased Bastian the day before. They look up at the 
sky as Falkor and Bastian appear and start chasing them. They 
scream

 

 


 

 

 


 

 


(one of them cries pointing to the alley. They 
start to rest, but Falkor chases 
them down there too. They start running 
again.)

 

 


They run down the alley and jump into the 
dumpster as Falkor flies by them, laughing. They peer out of the dumpster 
and then duck back in.

VIEW- of buildings and 
the sky. We hear a voice, a narrator.

 

 Bastian made 
many other wishes and had many other amazing
