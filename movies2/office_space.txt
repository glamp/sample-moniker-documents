[Scene: A highway. There's a huge traffic jam. Peter drives forward a 
bit at a time and he sees an old man with a walker on the sidewalk. The 
lane next to his is moving, so he switches lanes, only to have it stop 
and the lane he was on move. He switches back and then it happens 
again. The old man is now ahead of him.]

Cut to Michael, who's rapping along with the radio. A black guy selling 
papers walks by and he shuts the windows and turns down the volume. He 
passes and he turns it back up again.

if you could just remember to do that. from now on. That'd be great.

He walks away. Peter's phone rings and he answers it.

[Scene Michael and Samir's cubicle. They're sitting there worrying.]

MICHAEL


TOM

He goes to his cubicle.

PETER

we had a million dollars and didn't have to work. And invariably, 
whatever we would say, that was supposed to be our careers. If you 
wanted to build cars, then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic.

SAMIR


PETER


MICHAEL

(The printer is not working) 
If that quiz worked, there would be no janitors, because no one would

That's all right, i got one

jeans.

[Scene Milton's cubicle, under the banner. He's on the phone with 
Peter.]

MILTON

Bill that if he moves my desk one more time, then, then I'm quitting. 
I'm going to quit. And I told Dom too because they've moved my desk 
four times. I used to be by the window, where I could see the squirrels 
and they were merry. But then they switched from the Swingline to the 
Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline. (he's holding his red 
Swingline) (Camera pans to Peter) They have my staples for the Boston 
and I kept the staples from the Swingline stapler.

PETER


MILTON

fire.

PETER


He hangs up and looks at his watch

4:45. Peter looks around and sees Bill. He ducks and peeks to see Bill 
talking with some workers. He quickly tries to save his files, but the 
computer is slower than he'd like. Bill is talking to other guys.

PETER

for crying out -!

He peeks over the wall again. The computer finally finished saving and 
he turns it off. He peeks over the wall but Bill's not there. He gets 
ready to leave and almost runs into Bill.

BILL

in tomorrow. So if you could be here around nine, that would be great. 
(starts to walk away) Oh, oh, yeaI forgot. I'm gonna also need you to 
come in Sunday too. We, uh, lost some people this week and we need to 
sorta catch up. Thanks.

[Scene Outside the clinic. A sign says

Loss, Smoking, Insurance

Cut to inside. Anne is with Peter. Opposite them are Dr. Swanson and 
two other patients.

PETER

started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the 
day before it. So it means that every single day you see me, that's on 
the worse day of my life.

DR. SWANSON


PETER


DR. SWANSON


PETER


DR. SWANSON


PETER

way that I'll know I'm at work? Right here? (points to his head) Can I 
just come home and think I've been fishing all day or something?

DR. SWANSON

I can help you. I want you to do something for me, Peter. (dims the 
lights) I want you to try and relax. I want you to relax every muscle 
in your body, from your toes to your fingertips. Now I want you to 
relax your legs. You're going to begin to feel your eyelids getting 
heavy as you slip deeper and deeper into a state of complete 
relaxation. the air of concerns to you is disappearing. Deeper, way 
down, your concerns about your job melts away. Way, way down. Now when 
I count backwards from three, you'll be in a state of complete 
relaxation. your worries, cares and ambitions will be gone. And you 
will remain in that state until I snap my fingers. Three. Deeper and 
deeper. Way down, way down. Two. Way down. One.

He faints out of the chair and everyone rushes to his aid.

ANNE


She runs to get help. Peter just sits there and smiles. The hypnosis 
thing apparently worked...

friends. Don't blame this on hypnosis either. That's total bull!

Peter hangs up but Anne calls back.

ANNE



Peter gets back into bed.

He starts to walk away.

flair.

PETER


JOANNA


PETER

JOANNA


PETER

PETER


BOB SLYDELL


PETER

door, that way Lumbergh can't see me. Uh, and after that, I just sorta 
space out for about an hour.

BOB PORTER


PETER

for probably another hour after lunch too. I'd probably, say, in a 
given week, I probably do about fifteen minutes of real, actual work.

BOB SLYDELL

little more?

PETER


Cut to later. Peter is more relaxed.

PETER

care.

BOB PORTER

PETER

Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime. So where's 
the motivation? And here's another thing, Bob. I have eight different 
bosses right now!

BOB SLYDELL


PETER


BOB SLYDELL


PETER

people coming by to tell me about it. That's my real motivation - is 
not to be hassled. That and the fear of losing my job, but y'know, Bob, 
it will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired.

BOB SLYDELL


PETER


BOB SLYDELL

kind of stock option and equity sharing program?

It's about fun.

JOANNA

a glitch in Payroll, he still gets a paycheck. I went ahead and fixed 
the glitch.

BILL


DOM


BOB SLYDELL

won't be receiving a paycheck anymore. So it'll just work itself out 
naturally.

BOB PORTER

solved from here on, then.

They laugh.

BOB SLYDELL

young man and boy does he have Straight to Upper Management written all 
over him.

BILL

you there. Yeah. Uh, he's been real flaky lately and I'm not sure that 
he's the caliber person you want for upper management. He's been having

yeah. So I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk,

PETER


BOB PORTER

Singapore, that's the usual deal.

BOB SLYDELL


PETER


BOB SLYDELL

Friday. It's statistically shown that there's less chance of an 
incident if we do it at the end of the week. Anyway, Peter, what we 
would like to do is put you into a position where you would have as 
many as four people working right underneath you.

Come on. Come on, you little fucker. Let's go! That's what I need. 
Let's do that. Let's do exactly that, you little, fu-

Peter walks up to him.

PETER


[Scene Peter's place. Michael, Samir and Peter are there.]

PETER

now, when it doesn't hurt to think about the future.

MICHAEL

the one who's been flaking out at work. Whatever that religious

you're gonna get canned.

PETER

that, that could rip off the company for a bunch of money...

PETER


MICHAEL


PETER

today. It's not about me and my dream of doing nothing. It's about all 
of us together. I don't know what happened at that hypnotherapist the 
other day; maybe it was just shock. It's wearing off now, but when I 
saw that fat man keel over and die, Michael, I realized that we don't 
have a lot of time on this earth. We weren't meant to spend it this 
way. Human beings weren't meant to sit in little cubicles, starring at 
computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to 
eight different bosses drone on about mission statements.

MICHAEL


PETER

off at Initech, hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing 
or something. Five years of your mid-20s now, gone. And you're gonna go 
in tomorrow and they're gonna throw you out into the street. You know 
why? So Bill Lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point. Michael, 
let's make that stock go down. Let's take enough money from that place 
that we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again. Your software 
works right?

MICHAEL

I don't know how to install it. I don't know the credit union software 
loan.

PETER


[Scene Peter's apartment. Samir's there, along with Michael and Peter.]

SAMIR


PETER

That's too small to notice. Take a thousand withdrawals a day, space it 
out over a few years, that's a couple hundred thousand dollars.

MICHAEL


SAMIR

get my resume ready.

PETER

no reason?

SAMIR


PETER

around. Aren't you?

SAMIR


PETER

Riyadh! They're not gonna saw your hands off, all right? The worse they 
can do is put you for a couple of months into a while collar, minimum 
security resort! Shit, we should be so lucky! Did you know they have 
conjugal visits there?

SAMIR


PETER


MICHAEL


SAMIR

options

unemployment or early retirement. What's it gonna be?

do is load it anywhere into the credit union mainframe and it'll do the 
rest.

Allah, that nobody knows about this, all right? No family members, no 
girlfriends, nobody!
