                                      SHOOTING DRAFT



               FADE IN: TITLES APPEAR ON BLACK B.G.

TITLES END and we WIDEN to reveal that the black b.g. is 
actually the sludge-clogged surface of the Cuyahoga River. 
We TILT UP from the river to reveal the city of Cleveland, 
then follow with a series of shots of Cleveland landmarks.

               INT. THE INJUN DINER - DAY

Three men in Cleveland Indian baseball caps sit at the 
counter. BOBBY JAMES, 22-year-old grad student, VIC BOLITO, 
30-year-old telephone worker, and JOHNNY WYNN, 45-year-old 
house painter. THELMA GORDON, 65-year-old waitress, delivers 
their breakfast.

                                     THELMA
                         Spring training starts the twelfth. 
How do you think the Indians will do 
this year?

                                     VIC
                         They don't look too good.

The other two shake their heads in contemplation of this 
sorry fact.

               INT. MEN'S CLUB - DAY

A 45-year-old BUSINESS EXECUTIVE is talking to a fellow club 
member over lunch.

                                     BUSINESS EXECUTIVE
                         They don't look particularly good, 
do they?

               EXT. CLEVELAND DOCKS - DAY

Two LONGSHOREMEN are talking while they unload a freighter.

                                     LONGSHOREMEN
                         I'll tell ya. They don't look very 
fuckin' good.

               EXT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY

Down on the field, two KOREAN GROUNDSKEEPERS speak Korean as 
they resod the outfield.

                                     GROUNDSKEEPER
                              (in subtitles)
They're shitty.

We TILT UP from the field to a glass-enclosed area on the 
third deck.

               INT. GLASS-ENCLOSED AREA - DAY

It's the Cleveland Indians' conference room. Three men are 
seated around the table; CHARLIE DONOVAN. the manager, PHIL 
BUTLER, public relations head, JERRY SIMMONS, operations 
director and LYLE MATTHEWS director of player personnel 
Donovan taps his pencil impatiently, obviously waiting for 
somebody.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (checking his watch)
Thirty minutes late. Think she'll 
show?

                                     MATTHEWS
                         She's got to. She's the damn owner 
now.

                                     DONOVAN
                         She didn't last week. She was having 
a guava facial.

As Butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is, the 
conference room doors swing open and a muscular MALE SECRETARY-
BODYGUARD enters, clearing the way for MRS. RACHEL PHELPS, a 
flashy, striking woman in her early forties. Despite the 
designer clothes she favors, there is the hint of something 
less refined about her. She carries a Pekinese dog, CHA-CHA 
on her left hip.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to 
another season of Indians' baseball.

The men applaud, but their hearts are barely in it. The 
Secretary-Bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the 
table and Rachel sits.

                                     RACHEL
                         I know that it may not seem the same 
without Donald here this year, but I 
promise you by the end of the season 
this team will have made history.

Several eyes roll up around the room.

                                     RACHEL
                              (picking up a newspaper)
Unfortunately there are some in the 
press who feel that...
(reading from the 
page)
"the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps 
has no business being the owner of a 
major league baseball team."

Rachel crumbles the paper and throws it away.

                                     RACHEL
                         Obviously, Donald didn't feel that 
way or he wouldn't have left the 
team to me. And I was more than 
showgirl. I was a dancer. Now, I 
know some of you have doubts about 
my ability to run this franchise. 
God help you if I ever find out about 
it.

This causes a few nervous glances in the room.

                                     RACHEL
                         Spring training begins in two weeks.
(throwing a sheet of 
paper on the table)
Here's the list of people we'll be 
inviting to camp this year.

Donovan, Butler and Simmons pour over the list.

                                     RACHEL
                         I could sit here and tell you what a 
great year we're gonna have, but the 
facts are we lost the two best players 
we had to free agency. We haven't 
won a pennant in 30 years. We haven't 
even finished in the first division 
for 15. Obviously it's time to make 
some changes. What do ya think?

                                     SIMMONS
                         I never heard of half these guys. 
And the ones I do know are way past 
their prime.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Most of these guys never had a prime.

                                     BUTLER
                              (pointing to the sheet)
This guy here is dead.

                                     RACHEL
                         Cross him off then.

                                     BUTLER
                              (under his breath)
Let's not be hasty.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's time to shake things up, Charlie. 
Clear the board and start over.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Well, it's not the best material 
I've ever had to work with, but I'll 
do my best to see we move up a notch 
this year.

                                     RACHEL
                         I know you will, Charlie. That's why 
I'm movin' you up to General Manager. 
Congratulations.

Rachel sticks out her hand. Donovan shakes it somewhat feebly, 
bewildered by this whole development.

                                     RACHEL
                         Well, that should do it for today. 
Thank you, gentlemen. Let's get to 
work.

With that, Rachel gets up and breezes out of the room with 
her entourage, leaving Donovan and the others dumbfounded.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (checking his watch)
One minute, 58 seconds.

               INT. DONOVAN'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

Donovan, carrying a boxful of belongings under each arm, 
pushes open the door of his new office and walks inside. The 
basic outfitting is masculine enough, but the room is full 
of feminine little accents; flowers in vases, porcelain desk 
accessories etc. Donovan is slightly overwhelmed. Suddenly, 
there's a voice at the door.

                                     BODY-BUILDER ASSISTANT
                         Mr. Donovan, Mrs. Phelps would like 
to see you.

               OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. RACHEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Donovan is ushered in by Rachel's Male Secretary. Donovan 
carries his player roster with him.

               INT. RACHEL'S OFFICE - DAY CONT

                                     RACHEL
                         Come on in, Charlie. Have a seat.

                                     DONOVAN
                         I'm glad you called me in. I'm still 
unclear on a couple things

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh, really? Like what?

                                     DONOVAN
                         Well, if I'm the G.M., who's gonna 
be the Manager?

                                     RACHEL
                         I was thinking of Lou Brown.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Lou Brown?

                                     RACHEL
                         He's managed the Toledo Mud Hens of 
the International League for the 
last 30 years.

This is hardly an impressive credential to Donovan.

                                     RACHEL
                         I think he'll fit right in with our 
team concept.

                                     DONOVAN
                         What exactly is our team concept?

                                     RACHEL
                         That's what I wanted to talk to you 
about. I want to put together a team 
that will help us relocate to Miami.

                                     DONOVAN
                         What do you mean?
(referring to the 
roster)
Some of these guys are furniture 
movers?

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm serious about this, Charlie. 
It's no secret I've never liked 
Cleveland much. The weather's lousy, 
downtown is a pit, the stadium's 
falling apart, and we can't draw 
dick. Another couple of years of 
this and I'm gonna have to start 
feeding Cha-Cha dog food.

Rachel bends down to give her dog, Cha-Cha, a little love 
pat, while Donovan tries to contain his disgust.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Mrs. Phelps, you can't just up and 
move a team on a whim...

                                     RACHEL
                         It's hardly a whim. Miami's offered 
to build us a new stadium -- 62,000 
capacity, 45 V.I.P. boxes, and no 
rent for the first million at the 
gate. Plus a 12 million dollar media 
guarantee; 45 percent of the 
concession gross, all of the parking 
and they pick up the stadium 
operations costs. No other franchise 
in baseball can match that deal.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Even so, the League'll never let us 
leave Cleveland. We got a lease with 
the city.

                                     RACHEL
                         The lease says we have the right to 
move if our attendance falls below 
800,000 for the year.
(pushing across a 
copy of the lease)
Paragraph 40, line 17.

Donovan looks at it, the paragraph highlighted in yellow.

                                     RACHEL
                         If we play bad enough, we should be 
able to come in under that.

                                     DONOVAN
                         What are you saying? You want us to 
lose?

                                     RACHEL
                         No, we've been losing. What I want 
us to do is finish dead last.

Donovan is stunned. He casts around helplessly for some 
response.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Mister Phelps would never have 
approved of this.

                                     RACHEL
                         He knew it had to be done. He just 
didn't have the courage to do it.
(with veiled menace)
Hopefully, you will come to see the 
wisdom of it.
(pause)
If this team lives up to its 
potential, we could have the worst 
record in all baseball.

On Donovan's sunken face, we go to:

               EXT. SHABBY MEXICAN HOTEL - MORNING

On a stretch of deserted Mexican highway. OVER we hear a 
telephone RING.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

The room is a total mess. The back door is off its hinges 
and a few chickens have wandered in. As they peck around the 
debris, we PAN the room, taking in beer cans, food wrappers 
and finally a trail of hastily discarded clothes, both male 
and female.

We reach the bed and find our hero, JAKE TAYLOR, 35, and 
with a couple days growth of stubble, passed out on his face. 
Sprawled across him asleep is a MEXICAN WOMAN in her late 
twenties. She's not great looking, but at least she's 
overweight. Taylor's hand fumbles to the RINGING telephone.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Yeh.

It's Charlie Donovan calling from his office in Cleveland. 
We CUT BACK AND FORTH between the two as we will in subsequent 
phone scenes.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Hello, Jake? This is Charlie Donovan, 
new G.M. of the Cleveland Indians.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (skeptical)
Yeh...

                                     DONOVAN
                         I wanted to call and say the 
organization remembers you fondly 
from the years you played here and 
we'd love to have you come to spring 
training for a shot at this year's 
club.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Who is this?

                                     DONOVAN
                         What?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Is that you, Tolbert? This isn't 
very funny, ya know. I'm hung over. 
My knees are killin' me. If you were 
gonna pull this shit, you could've 
at least said you were from the 
Yankees.

Taylor struggles to get a look up at the girl on top of him.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (still to Donovan)
By the way, you were with me last 
night. Who's this girl on top of me?

Donovan is baffled by this whole line of conversation.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Tolbert? Tolbert? Screw it.

Taylor hangs up, leaving Donovan staring into his phone. 
Taylor looks up to see TOLBERT standing in the doorway.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Tolbert.

                                     TOLBERT
                         Who the hell were you talkin' to?

On Taylor's reaction, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TOLEDO TIRE STORE - DAY

We PICK UP LOU BROWN, a portly man in his early fifties, 
making his way to his glass-partitioned office.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Lines three and four are waiting for 
you, Mr. Brown. One guy about the TR-
70's.

                                     BROWN
                              (picking up the phone)
Tire World.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Lou? This is Charlie Donovan, the 
new G.M. of the Cleveland Indians. 
Listen, Lou, I hope you're sittin' 
down 'cause I got an offer you 
probably been dreamin' about your 
whole life. We been watchin' your 
progress down there at Toledo with a 
lotta interest and well...
(a dramatic pause)
How would you like to manage the 
Indians this year?

For a moment there's silence on the line, then:

                                     BROWN
                         I don't know...

                                     DONOVAN
                              (incredulous)
What do ya mean you don't know? This 
is a chance to manage in the big 
leagues.

                                     BROWN
                         Lemme think it over, will ya, Charlie. 
I got a guy on the other line about 
some whitewalls. I'll talk to ya 
later.

Brown clicks off. Donovan puts his head down on his desk.

               INT. CHARLIE DONOVAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Donovan's on the phone to another player.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Rick, we heard about your pitching 
out at Portland last year...

               RICKY VAUGHN

Good-looking, muscular, 19-year-old. Sleeveless black T-shirt. 
Talking on a wall phone in a nondescript room.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I'm, ah, not with them anymore...

Vaughn has been working, sweating slightly. He takes off his 
cap to mop his brow -- revealing a RADICAL HAIRCUT with 
PIGTAIL. He sports a RING in his left ear.

                                     DONOVAN
                         We'd still like to take a look at ya 
at our spring camp in Arizona, March 
first.

               LONG SHOT - VAUGHN

In the b.g., Vaughn is on the phone. In the f.g., we see 
security bars. Vaughn's in a Youth Authority prison.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Yeh, well, I'm not sure I can make 
it by then.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Don't worry, we're gettin' you out 
on a sort of work furlough deal. Any 
questions?

                                     VAUGHN
                         Yeh. Where's Cleveland?

               INT. DONOVAN'S OFFICE - DAY

On the speaker again to Lou Brown. Rachel watches, impatient 
for him to close the deal.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Look, Lou, you been in baseball thirty 
years. Don't you wanna advance some?

                                     BROWN
                              (eating a sack lunch)
I used to coach the unwed mothers' 
softball team. I have advanced some.

Rachel rubs her fingers together, making the money sign to 
Donovan.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Well, what are you really worried 
about? The money?

                                     BROWN
                         Naw, I'm just not sure I'd be happy 
in a big organization like that. 
Owners are always on your back, tryin' 
to "help you out."

                                     DONOVAN
                         I don't think that's gonna be a 
problem.

                                     BROWN
                         Down here baseball's a game, not a 
business. I don't wanta be a 
babysitter for a buncha millionaires 
who think they know it all already.

                                     DONOVAN
                         We don't have any millionaires.

                                     BROWN
                         Well then, bonus babies or whatever 
you got...

                                     DONOVAN
                         Don't have any bonus babies either.

                                     BROWN
                         Don't you have any proven major league 
talent?

                                     DONOVAN
                              (embarrassed)
Not that I know of.

                                     BROWN
                         Well, then... I'll be up in a couple 
days.

                                     DONOVAN
                         What?

                                     BROWN
                         Sounds like my kinda team. Have my 
contracts ready.

Brown hangs up.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (to the others)
Guess I really put the screws to 
him.

               EXT. MEXICAN LEAGUE BALL PARK - DAY

This one's a dandy. The left field wall is a 20-foot high, 
solid granite outcropping. A final out is made and the teams 
change over.

               TAYLOR

returning to the dugout at the end of the inning, wondering 
what the hell he's doin' here.

                                     MANAGER
                         Taylor, telephone for you.

Taylor goes to the phone in the clubhouse tunnel.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Hello.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Jake, Charlie Donovan again.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Oh yeh, Charlie, look, I'm sorry 
about this morning...

                                     DONOVAN
                         No problem. Look, Jake, camp starts 
on the first. Can you make it?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Sure.

                                     DONOVAN
                         You been stayin' in shape down there?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Oh hell, yeh, I work out every day.

                                     DONOVAN
                         I thought so. See ya in Arizona.

Donovan hangs up. Taylor shoots a fist in the air, and we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TAYLOR

approaching his MANAGER.

                                     MANAGER
                         Let's go, Taylor. You're up.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Luis, I'm not gonna be playin' 
anymore. I got a tryout in the States.

                                     MANAGER
                         Fine. Leave your uniform.

                                     TAYLOR
                         But I changed at the motel.

                                     MANAGER
                         Leave your uniform.

               TAYLOR

coming out of the stadium, his bats and gloves over his 
shoulder. He has on his spikes and a pair of boxer shorts.

               INT. BEAT-UP MEXICAN BUS - DAY

Taylor sits in the back seat. He has six Coke bottles filled 
with sand strapped to his ankles. He lifts his legs up and 
down to strengthen his muscles.

               OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. INDIANS' TRAINING CAMP PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

Donovan, Brown and two of his coaches, PEPPER LEACH (pitching) 
and DUKE TEMPLE (hitting) are on the field, witnessing the 
arrival of their "troops." First to arrive is:

               TAYLOR

He gets out of a taxi and goes to the trunk to get his bats 
and luggage.

                                     DONOVAN
                         This looks like Jake Taylor.

Brown turns around from a conversation with Temple.

                                     BROWN
                         He was an Allstar in Boston, wasn't 
he?

                                     DONOVAN
                         Yeh.

                                     PEPPER
                         Wish we had him two years ago.

                                     DONOVAN
                         We did.

                                     PEPPER
                         Four years ago then.

               INT. PLAYER'S BARRACKS - DAY

Like an Army barracks. Rows of bunk beds seperated by lockers. 
Taylor walks in with Temple, the hitting instructor.

                                     TAYLOR
                         What happened to the private rooms?

                                     TEMPLE
                         We're on an austerity program. This 
is what happens when you finish 24 
games out.

               BROWN, PEPPER, TEMPLE AND DONOVAN

back at the field, supervising the arrival of more players.

The first is a tall, muscular Latin, PEDRO CERRANO, dressed 
in black from head to toe. He arrives on foot, carrying a 
black suitcase and pulling a black bat case on wheels. He 
looks like a gunfighter coming into Dodge.

                                     BROWN
                         Who's that?

                                     DONOVAN
                         I think it's Cerrano. Defected from 
Cuba. Wanted religious freedom.

                                     BROWN
                         What's his religion?

                                     DONOVAN
                         Voodoo.

               BLACK AND TAN ROLLS-ROYCE

pulling into the parking lot. Out steps RODGER DORN, high-
priced third baseman. Brown eyes him with vague disapproval.

                                     BROWN
                         Thought you didn't have any high-
priced talent.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (sheepish)
I forgot about Dorn, 'cause he's 
only high-priced. Got him as a free 
agent three years ago.

                                     BROWN
                         Still hits the ball pretty well, 
doesn't he?

                                     DONOVAN
                         Yeh, he just can't field it.

Dorn pulls his golf clubs out of the car.

                                     BROWN
                         We'll shape him up.

               WILLIE HAYES

a 22-year-old black, pulling up in a '72 VW Beetle which 
he's got a Cadillac grille on. He steps out in his shades 
and sharkskin suit.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Don't recognize this guy.

Hayes strolls up and introduces himself.

                                     HAYES
                         Say hey, Willie Mays Hayes here. I 
play like Mays and run like Hayes.

                                     BROWN
                         Lou Brown. Nice to meet ya, Hayes.

                                     HAYES
                         Thanks. Well, I gotta get my stuff...

Hayes hustles off toward his car.

                                     DONOVAN
                         I don't remember a Hayes on the list.

A motorcycle pulls to a stop in the lot, diverting everyone's 
attention from Hayes.

Off steps Ricky Vaughn, a hefty bag over his shoulder. He's 
still sporting his radical do.

                                     PEPPER
                         Look at this fuckin' guy.

                                     TEMPLE
                         Maybe he's the mascot.

Donovan is speechless. Brown breaks into a small smile. Yes, 
sir, this is his kinda team.

               INT. PLAYERS' BARRACKS

Taylor is putting his stuff away in a locker. Vaughn enters 
the barracks and immediately draws the attention of Dorn.

                                     DORN
                         Hey, what do we have here? Guy looks 
like a fuckin' toilet brush. Hey, 
T.B., I love your pony tail. And the 
earring's cute too. Where's the 
matching bracelet?

Vaughn whips a hard glance at Dorn, but keeps on walking, 
making his way along the bunks looking for his assigned bed. 
It's the one above Taylor. Vaughn unloads his duffel bag in 
silence.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (offering his hand)
Jake Taylor.

Vaughn shakes it and nods. Says nothing.

                                     TAYLOR
                         So, you just gonna settle for toilet 
brush, or you got another name?

                                     VAUGHN
                         Vaughn. Rick Vaughn.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Forget about Dorn. He's always a 
little tough on rookies. You'll get 
a lot worse from other teams.

The conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Hayes.

                                     HAYES
                         Say hey! How ya doin'? Willie Mays 
Hayes here.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Jake Taylor.
(pointing to Vaughn)
Rick Vaughn.

Hayes doesn't quite know what to make of Vaughn.

                                     HAYES
                         What the hell league you been playin' 
in?

                                     VAUGHN
                         California Penal.

                                     HAYES
                         Never heard of it. How'd you wind up 
playin' there?

                                     VAUGHN
                         I stole a car.

On Hayes' look, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS - NIGHT

It's dark. Everyone's asleep. Three SECURITY GUARDS with 
flashlights come down to the top bunk where Hayes is sleeping.

                                     GUARD
                         This guy wasn't invited to camp.

They lift the bunk out of its slots and carry it out the 
door, Hayes still asleep on it.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

The players are dressing out in their uniforms for the first 
day of practice. Vaughn goes in his locker and finds that a 
slit has been cut in the back of his cap to accommodate his 
pigtail. Suppressed laughs are heard from several corners of 
the locker room.

               INT. CLUBHOUSE - MORNING

Brown is addressing his troops before the first workout.

                                     BROWN
                         Welcome to Spring Training, gentlemen. 
Most managers tell you at this time 
that all the jobs are open, that 
nobody's a lock at any position, and 
that talent isn't everything. They'd 
rather see desire and discipline in 
a player. Then they tell you that 
most of all they want you to have 
fun out there, even though they're 
gonna work your ass off on 
fundamentals and condition you till 
you drop. The difference between me 
and those other managers is...
(pause)
I mean it.

On a locker room full of uneasy faces, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PRACTICE FIELD PARKING LOT - MORNING

Hayes' cot is sitting in the lot, just outside the fence, 
his suitcase set down next to it. Hayes is still asleep, dew 
on his forehead. Wakened by the noise of activity on the 
field, he sits up with a start.

                                     HAYES
                         Shit, I been cut already?

               THE PRACTICE FIELD

We pick up Taylor sprinting his ass off in a 100-yard time 
trial, staggering across the finish line 10 feet behind 
Cerrano.

                                     PEPPER
                              (checking stopwatch)
11.9 Taylor. Not bad if you'd fallen 
down.

As Taylor tries to catch his breath, Dorn and a relief pitcher 
named Gant approach the starting line for the next trial.

               HAYES

looking through the chain-link fence surrounding the field.

               DORN AND GENTRY AGAIN

Temple brings them to their marks and blows his whistle. 
Dorn and Gentry take off.

Suddenly Hayes, in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking 
toward the starting line in hot pursuit. Dorn and Gentry a 
good 10-yard lead, but Hayes is coming like a bullet. We go 
to SLOW MOTION as Hayes draws even at the 80-yard mark and 
blasts on by to win by five. This kid is fast. Brown and 
Pepper give each other the "Who was that Masked Man" look.

                                     BROWN
                         Get him a uniform.

               EXT. THE PRACTICE FIELD - LONG SHOT - DAY

The players are spread out on the field doing calisthenics, 
counting off in unison.

               TAYLOR

struggling through a series of pushups. He glances over in 
disbelief at Vaughn and Cerrano, who are doing them like 
pistons in competition with each other. Cerrano even starts 
doing them one-handed.

Hayes isn't doing them at all; merely pulling his head up 
and down while leaving his body on the ground.

                                     HARRIS
                         C'mon, Hayes, let's do 'em right.

                                     HAYES
                         Hey, my philosophy is no pain, no 
pain.

               EXT. THE BATTING CAGE - DAY

Taylor is crouched behind the plate, warming up his arm. 
Catching pitches and throwing them half-speed down to second. 
Brown drifts over.

                                     BROWN
                         How the knees holdin' up, Jake?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Great. Never been better.

                                     BROWN
                         Mobility's good? No problem gettin' 
off the throw to second?

                                     TAYLOR
                         No problem.

                                     BROWN
                         I need a catcher, Jake. Somebody who 
can keep this team together on the 
field. You were a helluva player 
when you were sound, but around the 
league they think you can't take the 
pounding anymore.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Around the league they're wrong.

                                     BROWN
                         I'm gonna have to put you to the 
test, ya know. So, I want the absolute 
truth here. Are you 100 percent?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Yeh. Would I bullshit about somethin' 
like that?

                                     BROWN
                              (walking away)
You better if you wanna make this 
team.

Taylor smiles and fires one full-speed down to second. It 
bounces two feet in front of the bag.

               EXT. BATTING CAGE - DAY

Brown is watching batting practice.

Hayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory ritual 
worthy of Babe Ruth -- rubbing dirt on his hands, stretching, 
knocking dirt off his spikes, twirling the bat, etc. A real 
slugger's routine.

                                     BROWN
                         C'mon, Hayes, this isn't the All 
Star Game. Get up to the damn plate.

Hayes gets in and takes his stance. On the first pitch, he 
takes a mighty cut and hits a pop-fly to the pitcher's mound. 
We take QUICK CUTS of the next three pitches. Hayes takes 
prodigious swings at all of them, producing three more pop-
ups, none out of the infield. Brown calls a halt.

                                     BROWN
                         Well, you may run like Mays, but you 
hit like shit.

                                     HAYES
                         My stroke'll come back once I get 
warmed up.

                                     TEMPLE
                              (referring to some 
stats)
Never did get warmed up last year. 
Hit .211 at Maine. I looked him up.

                                     BROWN
                         I think Mr. Hayes shows some promise. 
His speed could be a big asset.

                                     PEPPER
                              (aside)
For what? Running back to the dugout?

                                     BROWN
                         You gotta stop swingin' for the fences 
though, Hayes. All you're gonna do 
is give yourself a hernia. With your 
speed you should be hittin' the ball 
on the ground, leggin' 'em out. Every 
time I see you hit one in the air, 
you owe me twenty pushups.

                                     HAYES
                         Hey, no problem.

The next pitch comes in. Hayes swings and pops it up.

                                     HAYES
                         Shit.

As he gets down to do his twenty, Brown turns to Temple.

                                     BROWN
                         Sometimes you can teach a guy to 
hit. You can't teach him to run.

               BROWN AND PEPPER

coming over to where Vaughn is tossing some casual warm-up 
pitches to Jake.

                                     BROWN
                         All right, Vaughn, they tell us you're 
a pitcher. Let's see what you got.

Brown and Pepper stand behind Taylor for a better view. Vaughn 
goes into his wind-up and fires a screaming fast ball that 
Taylor has no chance to get out of his crouch to catch. The 
ball rockets an inch over Brown's head, and slams into the 
backstop.

Brown stands frozen a second, contemplating his brush with 
eternity, then turns to Pepper.

                                     BROWN
                         Nice velocity.

                                     PEPPER
                         Sounded like it.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Sorry, Lou, I wasn't quite expectin' 
that much octane.

Brown turns to the Clubhouse Man who's holding a speed gun.

                                     BROWN
                         How much?

                                     CLUBHOUSE MAN
                         96 miles an hour.

                                     BROWN
                              (to Pepper)
Better teach him some control before 
he kills somebody.

               RODGER DORN

fielding grounders at third base. He plays them off to his 
left side a bit, almost as if he's afraid to get bit by them.

                                     BROWN
                         C'mon, Dorn, get in front of the 
damn ball.
(making like a 
bullfighter)
Don't give me this ole' bullshit.

                                     DORN
                         I took one of these in the eye last 
year. Nearly lost my sight.

                                     BROWN
                         I'm deeply moved. Every time you 
play it off your hip, you give me 
forty sit-ups.

                                     DORN
                         What! That's Little League shit.

                                     BROWN
                         So is this.

Brown strikes an effeminate fielding position, like Betty 
Grable shying from a mouse. Dorn burns.

               PEDRO CERRANO

in the batting cage, knocking the cover off pitch after pitch 
with his black bat.

                                     BROWN
                         Jesus, this guy hits a ton. How come 
nobody else picked up on him?

                                     TEMPLE
                              (to the batting 
practice pitcher)
Okay, Harris, that's enough fast 
balls. Throw some curves.

Harris winds and throws a fair-to-middlin' curve ball. Cerrano 
swings and misses it a foot.

                                     BROWN
                         Oh.

Dorn approaches Brown at the cage.

                                     DORN
                         Lou, I wanna have a word with you 
here.

                                     BROWN
                         Sure.

                                     DORN
                              (whipping out his 
contract)
Those penalty sit-ups you want me to 
do? I got it right here in my contract 
that I don't have to do any 
calisthenics I don't feel are 
necessary. What do ya think of that?

Everyone around the batting cage has stopped what they're 
doing to see how Brown will react. Brown looks at the contract 
a second, then drops it on the ground, unzips his fly, and 
gives it a golden shower. On Dorn's stunned face, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DORN

doing sit-ups in the infield. Vaughn walks by and smiles.

               LONGSHOT - PRACTICE FIELD

Practically every member of the team is doing penalty 
calisthenics somewhere on the field.

                                     PEPPER
                              (to Temple)
We got anybody left playin' baseball 
out there?

               INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn drag in, looking beat from the day's 
workout.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Shit, the way I played today, I 
wouldn't be surprised if they red-
tagged me already.

                                     HAYES
                         What do ya mean?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Red tag in your locker means the 
manager wants to see you, 'cause you 
just died and went to the minors.

Vaughn's hand freezes on his locker latch, afraid to open it 
now.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Don't worry, they don't cut anybody 
the first day.

Vaughn is still not so sure. He sits down on his locker stool 
and glances over toward STEVE HARRIS a starting pitcher, 
whose locker is adjacent. As Harris takes off his jersey we 
see three SPLOTCHES OF GREASY SUBSTANCES on his chest, just 
inside the button line.

                                     VAUGHN
                         What is that stuff?

                                     HARRIS
                              (pointing to them in 
order)
Crisco, Bardahl, Vagisil. Any one of 
'em will give you another 2-3 inches 
drop on your curve ball.

Vaughn can't believe this.

                                     HARRIS
                         Course if it's cold and I got a shirt 
on under my jersey, I just rub a 
little jalapeno inside my nose and 
get it runnin'. I need to load up 
the ball a little, I just wipe my 
nose.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (revolted)
You put snot on the ball?

                                     HARRIS
                         At my age, you put anything you can 
find on it. I haven't got an arm 
like yours.

Vaughn just looks at him incredulous.

               TAYLOR AND CARRANO

Taylor is undressing, but his attention is diverted by Cerrano 
whose stall is right next to him. Cerrano has set up an altar 
in his locker. In front of his bats, which are lined up like 
sentinels, is a table covered with pictures of baseball 
players, figurines of saints, several lit candles and, in 
the middle, a primitive fetish doll with a cigar in its mouth.

Cerrano has drawn some magic signs on his bats. He finishes 
an incantation and then lights the cigar on the fetish doll.

                                     TAYLOR
                         What are you doin' there, Pedro?

                                     CERRANO
                         Bats. They are sick.

                                     TAYLOR
                         So are mine. Is somethin' goin' 
around?

                                     CERRANO
                         No hit curve ball. Straight ball, 
hit it very much. Curve ball, bats 
are afraid. I ask Jo-Buu to come. 
Take fear from bats.

                                     HAYES
                         Jo-Buu?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Maybe he's the pagan saint of 
baseball.

                                     CERRANO
                         I offer him cigars and gin. He will 
come.

Cerrano pours some gin in a small cup and puts it next to 
the fetish doll. Harris has been listening to all this. 
Cerrano grabs a towel to head for the showers.

                                     HARRIS
                         I wouldn't leave this gin sittin' 
around out here with this group.

                                     CERRANO
                              (with a certain gravity)
Is very bad to steal Jo-Buu's gin. 
Is very bad.

Cerrano closes his locker and goes off to the showers, leaving 
everyone to wonder just how bad.

               OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

               MONTAGE SEQUENCE

compressing and detailing the progress of spring training. 
We see:

A) Vaughn on the pitcher's mound. A tin replica of a batter 
has been set up at home plate and rope stretched across the 
plate to delineate the strike zone. Vaughn fires a pitch and 
hits the tin batter in the hip, leaving a dent in him.

B) Cerrano in the batting cage, flailing away in futility at 
several curve balls.

               C) HAYES

doing push-ups at night. He's the only one left on the field, 
except Temple, who supervises.

               D) TAYLOR

doing the "scramble" drill -- blocking down balls purposely 
thrown in the dirt, one after another. When it ends, he can 
hardly get to his feet.

               E) CERRANO

waving a ten-foot BOA CONSTRICTOR in the sign of the cross 
in front of his locker before opening it. No red tag greets 
him. Hayes watches from a safe distance.

               F) VAUGHN

holding a mirror under the vents on his locker door to get a 
peek inside to see if there's a red tag there.

               G) DORN

taking a hard ground ball off the chest. Brown applauds. 
Dorn is pissed.

               H) VAUGHN

throwing at the "ropes" again. The tin batter is dented in 
every conceivable place now. Vaughn whips in another fast 
ball. This one hits the tin man in the head, knocking it 
completely off.

               I) TAYLOR

in an exhibition game, attempting to throw out a base stealer. 
Jake springs out of his crouch and fires down to second -- 
on a bounce. The ball skips into center field.

               J) HAYES

also in an exhibition game, swinging at a pitch and popping 
it up behind the plate. He just drops in his tracks and starts 
to do push-ups as the catcher makes the catch behind him.

               K) CERRANO

flailing away again at a curve ball. This and the remaining 
shots are all in exhibition games.

               L) HAYES

waving a ten-inch garter snake in front of his locker. Even 
at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but 
it works its magic. No red tag.

               M) VAUGHN

with a runner on third, winding up and throwing a pitch four 
feet over Taylor's head. The run scores.

               N) HAYES

attempting to steal second. He goes into a hell-bent-for-
leather head first slide. Unfortunately, he comes up two 
feet short of the base. The second baseman, who's waiting 
for him with the ball, makes a motion for him to keep coming. 
Hayes flips him the bird.

               O) LOU BROWN

on the bench. He turns to Pepper with a look that says, "Can 
you believe this shit?"

               P) TAYLOR

waiting for a throw at the plate. Just as he's about to catch 
it, the runner knocks him flat.

               Q) BROWN

his head in his hands. As Taylor gets up and goes to the 
wrong dugout, the MONTAGE ENDS.

               EXT. INDIANS' PRACTICE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

Players are filing off the team bus after the game. We PICK 
UP Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn as they head toward the locker 
room.

                                     VAUGHN
                         This is final cut down day, right?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Yeh, better get your snake ready, 
Hayes.

                                     HAYES
                         No, I'm goin' cold turkey today. My 
hands are too screwed up to hold it 
anyway.

Hayes reveals a pair of red and cut hands.

                                     TAYLOR
                         If you're gonna use that head first 
slide, you better get yourself some 
gloves or you're not gonna have any 
skin left on your hands.

They've reached the locker room now.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I don't wanna go in there.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Whatever happens, keep it to yourself 
until you're outta the locker room. 
Don't celebrate in front of guys who 
just died.

                                     HAYES
                         What if we're one of the deceased?

Taylor goes into the locker room. Hayes and Vaughn hang back.

Cerrano is already at his locker. He's got two snakes this 
time and some kind of voodoo head dress on. He sprays a patch 
of white paint on the locker door from a spray can, draws a 
symbol door. No tag. He kisses the snake, leaving some white 
paint on his lips, like a kid who's just had a glass of milk.

Taylor, exhausted from the game, lifts his latch and peers 
inside. He's made it, too. Cerrano offers a hand. Taylor 
shakes it and breaks a weary smile.

               GENTRY

opens locker, slumps on stool. He's a goner.

               HAYES AND VAUGHN

the two rookies, are still hanging back.

                                     HAYES
                         C'mon, Vaughn, let's show some nuts 
here. If they cut us, we'll just 
sign with the Yankees.

Hayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open. This 
doesn't tell him much, however, because he's got his eyes 
closed. He stands that way a beat ot two, then opens one 
eye.

Seeing no tag, he turns and walks double-time out of the 
locker room, as if he had to get to the john.

He comes outside, turns a corner, and starts leaping around 
like a wild man.

               VAUGHN

drawing strength from Hayes, walks resolutely to his locker 
and whips it open. There hanging from the top hook is the 
"red death." Vaughn stares at it expressionless, then slowly 
closes his locker.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BROWN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

Vaughn goes right in without knocking and leans on Brown's 
desk.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I got news for you, Mr. Brown. You 
haven't heard the last of me. You 
think I'm shit now, but someday you'll 
be sorry you cut me. I'm gonna catch 
on somewhere else, and every time I 
pitch against you, I'm gonna stick 
it up your ass.

                                     BROWN
                         Good, I like that kinda spirit in a 
player. The only problem is, I didn't 
cut you.

                                     VAUGHN
                         What do you mean?

                                     BROWN
                         I think somebody's been havin' fun 
with you.

We GO TO Vaughn, his faced a mask of anger and embarrassment.

               THE LOCKER ROOM AGAIN

Vaughn charges across the room and jumps Dorn. The men grapple 
and fight all over the room, until Taylor finally gets them 
separated.

                                     DORN
                              (to Vaughn)
What's the matter, little lady? Can't 
you take a joke?

Vaughn gives Dorn a look that indicates this isn't over. Lou 
Brown enters the room.

                                     BROWN
                         Can I have your attention, please? I 
counted up your ballots for team 
captain and I think you chose the 
right guy. If you hadn't, I woulda 
told you he won anyway. Mr. C for 
the year -- Jake Taylor.

The team breaks into applause and whistles as Taylor's name 
is announced. Dorn is the only one who seems unhappy about 
it. As Taylor accepts the congratulations of his teammates, 
he turns to Vaughn.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Forget about Dorn. You got other 
things to do.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Like what?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Packing for Cleveland.

Taylor gives him a wide smile. Vaughn finally allows himself 
one.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE CLEVELAND SKYLINE - DAY

Such as it is. We MOVE DOWN to the same diner we saw during 
the opening of the film.

               INT. INJUN DINER - DAY

The same three guys as before are at the counter.

                                     THELMA
                         You see the new lineup the Indians 
got?

                                     BOBBY
                         I never heard of most of 'em.

               INT. EXECUTIVE LIMOUSINE - DAY

The Business Executive is talking to the limo driver as he 
reads the sports section.

                                     BUSINESS EXECUTIVE
                         I don't know the majority of these 
names.

               EXT. CLEVELAND DOCKS - DAY

The two Longshoremen again, looking at a paper.

                                     LONGSHOREMAN
                         Who are these fuckin' guys?

               EXT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY

The two Korean Groundskeepers again, dragging the infield.

                                     GROUNDSKEEPER
                              (in subtitles)
They're shitty.

               INT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY

Taylor is alone in the stadium, standing near home plate in 
his street clothes, taking in the massive stadium, remembering 
glories past. He steps into the batter's box and takes his 
stance.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (to himself)
Two down. Bottom of the ninth.

Taylor points to the left field stands. He imagines a pitch 
coming in, takes a mighty swing and admires the flight of 
the imaginary ball as it arches high in the mid-day sky, 
landing deep in the left field seats. Breaking into his home 
run trot, he circles the bases, slapping the third base 
coach's hand and exchanging low fives with his teamates as 
he reaches the plate.

Suddenly, his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause. 
He turns and looks in the dugout, where Hayes and Vaughn are 
giving him a hand.

                                     HAYES
                         Really got all of that one.

                                     VAUGHN
                         What was it? A slider?

Taylor is too embarrassed to reply.

               INT. CLEVELAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT

One of Cleveland's finest. Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn are seated 
at a table.

                                     TAYLOR
                         What are you gonna have?

                                     HAYES
                         I don't know. What language is this?

                                     TAYLOR
                         French.

                                     HAYES
                         They got patty melts over there?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Forget it. I'll order. Let's have a 
toast.

The three raise their wine glasses.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Here's to baseball, here's to the 
start of two great careers, and for 
me, here's to at least one more good 
year in the sun.

The glasses CLINK. Suddenly Taylor's attention fixes on 
something across the room -- a stunning young woman in her 
late twenties, LYNN WESTLAND. She's having dinner with a 
DATE in a three-piece suit.

Hayes and Vaughn follow Taylor's eyes to the woman.

                                     VAUGHN
                         What is it? The chick?

                                     TAYLOR
                         That's my wife.

                                     HAYES
                         Does she know it?

                                     TAYLOR
                         I mean she woulda been if I hadn't 
screwed it up. Who's that guy she's 
with?

                                     HAYES
                         I don't know. He's not wearing a 
name tag.

                                     VAUGHN
                         You want me to beat the shit out of 
him?

                                     TAYLOR
                         No.

                                     HAYES
                         What does she do?

                                     TAYLOR
                         She's a librarian.

                                     VAUGHN
                         A librarian? Shit, I gotta start 
readin' again.

               INT. CLEVELAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A WAITER approaches the table where Lynn and her date are 
sharing a dessert.

                                     WAITER
                         Miss Wells, there's a telephone call 
for you.

Lynn is somewhat surprised, but gets up to take the call. We 
FOLLOW her to the pay phone in the hall.

                                     LYNN
                         Hello.

                                     VOICE
                         Hello, Lynn. It's Jake.

                                     LYNN
                         Jake? How did you know I was here?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Just a hunch. I took you there when 
you got your masters. I figure you're 
probably wearing the black velvet 
dress with the red sash.

She is indeed. Lynn is a little unsettled by this display of 
clairvoyance.

                                     LYNN
                         How did you know that? I didn't have 
this dress when we were...

Sensing that something's askew, she turns and looks across 
the way to see Jake talking to her on the pay phone on the 
other side of the hall, maybe ten feet away. He gives her 
his best grin.

                                     TAYLOR
                         You look great.

Lynn, as is often the case with Jake, is both charmed and 
put-out. She goes with put-out.

                                     LYNN
                         Thanks. What are you doin' here? 
Aren't you supposed to be in Mexico 
somewhere?

                                     TAYLOR
                         I'm playin' with the Indians again. 
Back in the Bigs.

                                     LYNN
                         That's great. I'm happy for you, 
Jake.

And she is. Not so sure about herself, though.

                                     LYNN
                              (starting away)
I gotta get back...

                                     TAYLOR
                         Wait a minute. What's your number. I 
tried calling you at home, but you're 
not listed...

                                     LYNN
                         My life is different from when you 
knew me.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Meaning what? That I don't know you 
anymore?

                                     LYNN
                         Couldn't we talk about this some 
other time? I really gotta...

                                     TAYLOR
                         Okay, just gimme your number.

                                     LYNN
                         I don't think that's a good idea.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Why not? Because of the guy you're 
with? What is he, a banker?

                                     LYNN
                         Lawyer. Please, Jake, he's watching 
us.

                                     TAYLOR
                         I'm not leavin' without your number. 
You still wear those great little 
tortoise-shell glasses? I always 
loved it when you took them off.

                                     LYNN
                              (exasperated)
Jake...

                                     TAYLOR
                         The number, Lynn...

                                     LYNN
                              (reluctant)
All right. 555-9314.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Thank you. I'm back, Lynn, and I'm 
gonna be around.

She looks at him a beat, unsure what to say, then heads back 
toward her table. We go to Lynn's date. None of this has 
been lost on him.

               INT. TAXI - DAY

Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn are the fares.

                                     CABBIE
                         What's the number again?

                                     TAYLOR
                              (looking at a piece 
of paper)
                         1036. 

                                     HAYES
                         What is this place?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Furnished apartment building owned 
by the Indians. We get special rates. 
With what we're makin' we'll need 
it.

The Cabbie pulls to a stop and points to the other side of 
the street.

                                     CABBIE
                         That's it.

Taylor and the others turn to see a dismal, run-down building 
with a neon sign that says "The Turk."

                                     TAYLOR
                         Welcome to the Big Leagues.

               INT. THE TURK - DAY

Jake goes to a pay phone in the hall and dials the number 
Lynn gave him.

                                     VOICE ON PHONE
                         Hello, Cuyahoga Sheet Metal.

Taylor doesn't like the sound of this.

                                     TAYLOR
                         You got anybody workin' there named 
Lynn Wells?

                                     VOICE ON PHONE
                         Never heard of her.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Didn't think so.

Taylor hangs up, staring off into space.

               INT. THE INDIANS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Various players are dressing out for the game. We PICK UP 
Cerrano putting on his undergarments. They're all black, 
including his jock. Dorn reads the Wall Street Journal, while 
Taylor sits on the trainer's table getting his knees taped.

Hayes checks the fit of his new uniform from every angle in 
a mirror. He thinks he looks pretty good. Vaughn just squeezes 
a baseball in his left hand, obviously a little uptight. 
Taylor gives him a chuck on the shoulder.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Take it easy. We got 162 of these to 
go.

Lou Brown enters the locker room.

                                     BROWN
                         All right, let's gather 'round.

The players turn their attention to Brown.

                                     BROWN
                         I'm not much for inspirational 
addresses. I just wanta point out 
that every newspaper in the country 
has picked us to finish last. The 
local press thinks we'd save everybody 
a lot of time and trouble if we just 
went out and shot ourselves. Me, I 
like to waste sportswriters' time so 
I'm for hangin' around and seein' if 
we can give all these guys a nice 
big shitburger to eat.

Cheers all around.

                                     HARRIS
                         Aren't we gonna have a prayer? I 
mean we're not all savages like 
Cerrano.

                                     BROWN
                         You guys go ahead. I belong to the 
church of three-run homers.

                                     HARRIS
                         All right, let's bow our heads.

Many of the players follow suit. Suddenly the silence is 
shattered by a loud explosive SOUND, scaring the hell out of 
everybody. All eyes turn to Cerrano, who has just set off a 
charge of gunpowder on his locker altar.

                                     CERRANO
                         Have to wake up bats.

Disgusted, Harris and the others turn back to their prayers.

                                     HARRIS
                         Dear Lord, we ask...

Harris never gets to finish. The smoke rising from Cerrano's 
gunpowder explosion sets off the automatic sprinklers in the 
ceiling. As Harris and the faithful look up into the downpour, 
we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY

The stands are nearly empty. Of the fans who have showed up, 
many wear doormats around their necks.

Bobby, Vic, Johnny and Thelma, our four fans from the diner, 
sit alone in the vast expanse of the centerfield bleachers. 
All four wear Indian head dresses and have war paint on their 
faces. The three men each have tom-toms. Thelma works on her 
needlepoint.

                                     JOHNNY
                         You read the Plain Dealer today? 
They said this is gonna be the worst 
Indian team we've had in years.

                         Everybody laughs at the Indians now, 
but there were other times. Even won 
the Series in '48. Then Willie Mays 
made that catch on Vic Wertz in the 
'54 Series and Cleveland's never 
been the same since.

                         As the Indians go so goes Cleveland, 
huh?

                                     THELMA
                         If we ever lost the Indians, Cleveland 
would die.

               INT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM PRESS BOX - DAY

We get our fist glimpse of HARRY DOYLE, the Indians' 55-year-
old radio announcer. Harry's never walked past a bar in anger. 
He's been with the Indians through thin and thinner.

                                     DOYLE
                              (on the air)
Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle here, 
welcoming all you Friends of the 
Feather to another season of Indians 
baseball.
(pouring some Jack 
Daniels in his Coke)
A lotta new faces for the tribe this 
year, as they take on the defending 
American League champs, the New York 
Yankees. And listen to the roar of 
the crowd as the Indians takes the 
field!

Doyle leans out the press box window with his mike, trying 
to pick up the sound of a couple guys CLAPPING down below.

                                     DOYLE
                         Yes, sir, they love this club here 
in Cleveland.

Doyle takes a hit of his spiked Coke.

               DOWN ON THE FIELD

               A YANKEE HITTER

flies out to Hayes, who makes a "basket" catch a la Willie 
Mays.

                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
                         High fly ball, centerfield. Hayes 
under it now... Oh, makes a basket 
catch, Willie Mays style, and the 
side is retired.

               THE INDIAN DUGOUT

The team comes in off the field to much enthusiasm and back-
slapping.

                                     BROWN
                         All right, way to look, way to look. 
Nice catch, Hayes. Don't ever fuckin' 
do it again. Okay, let's get it goin'!

               DOYLE IN THE PRESS BOX

                                     DOYLE
                         Bottom of the first, Willie Mays 
Hayes to lead it off for the tribe.

               HAYES

going through his warmup routine at the plate.

                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
                         A lotta people say you can tell how 
a season's gonna go by the first 
hitter of the year. In the last 
fifteen years, the Indians have never 
had the season lead-off hitter reach 
base.

Hayes is in the batter's box now. The Yankee pitcher winds 
and fires. Hayes swings and hits a little dribbler toward 
the second baseman, who races in and scoops it up bare-handed.

                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
                         Hot shot toward the hole. Rudia knocks 
it down, gets up, fires to first. 
Too late! Hayes beats it!

Doyle leans out the window again trying to pick up some 
cheering.

                                     DOYLE
                         And so the string is broken. Maybe 
things will turn around a little for 
the Indians this year.
