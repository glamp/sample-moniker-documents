               GRAHAM DALTON, twenty-nine, drives his '69 Cutlass while smoking 
a cigarette. One could describe his appearance as punk/arty, 
but neither would do him justice. He is a man of obvious 
intelligence, and his face is amiable. There is only one key 
on his keyring, and it is in the ignition.


                              (voice over)
Garbage. I started thinking about 
what happens to all the garbage. 
I mean, where do we put all of 
it, we have to run out of places 
to put it eventually, don't we? 
This happened to me before when 
that barge with all the garbage 
was stranded and nobody would take 
it? Remember that?



               ANN BISHOP MILLANEY, twenty-six, sits opposite her therapist.
She is an extremely attractive woman, dressed in a mature preppy 
style. There is a wedding ring on her left hand.


                         Yes, I remember. What do you do 
when these moods overtake you?


                         Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try 
not to do anything that will 
produce garbage, so obviously we're 
talking about eating and basic 
stuff like that. Did you know that 
the average person produces three 
pounds of garbage a day?


                         No, I didn't.


                         Don't you think that's a lot of 
garbage? I'd really like to know 
where it's all going to go.


                         Do you have any idea what triggered 
this concern?


                         Well, this weekend John was taking 
out the garbage, and he kept 
spilling things out of the 
container, and I started imagining 
a container that grew garbage, 
like it just kept filling up and 
overflowing all by itself, and 
how could you stop that if it 
started happening?


                         Ann, do you see a pattern here?


                         What do you mean?


                         Well, last week we talked about 
your obsession with the families 
of airline fatalities, and now 
we're talking about your concern 
over the garbage problem.


                         Yeah, so?


                         If you think about it, I think 
you'll see that the object of your 
obsession is invariably something 
negative that you couldn't possibly 
have any control over.


                         Well, do you think many people 
run around thinking about how happy 
they feel and how great things 
are? I mean, maybe they do, but 
I doubt those people are in 
therapy. Besides, being happy isn't 
all that great. My figure is always 
at its best when I'm depressed. 
The last time I was really happy 
I put on twenty-five pounds. I 
thought John was going to have 
a stroke.


                              (voice over)
It's true, I'm telling you.



               JOHN MILLANEY, twenty-nine, sits at his desk talking on the
telephone. He is dressed very well, sporting real suspenders 
with his striped pinpoint oxford shirt and cotton suit. He 
fingers the wedding ring on his left hand.


                         As soon as you've got a ring on 
your finger, you start getting 
serious attention from the opposite 
gender. Seriously, I wish I had 
Super Bowl seats for every time 
I had some filly just come up 
and start talking to me without 
the slightest provocation. That 
never happened before I got 
married. Shit, if I'd known that, 
I'd have gone out and bought me 
a ring when I was eighteen and 
saved myself a lot of time and 
money.

               John looks at his watch.


                         Shit, I gotta be someplace.
(quickly)
Look, racquetball Thursday? You're 
the coolest.

               John presses the intercom button while putting on his jacket.


                         Uh, Janet, re-schedule Kirkland. 
Tell him to come in Friday at 1:30.


                              (voice over, to Ann) 
Are you still keeping these 
thoughts from John?


                              (voice over)
Yes.



               John brushes his teeth and combs his hair very carefully.


                              (voice over, to Ann)
Are you afraid of his reaction? 
Of his finding you silly for 
thinking of such things?


                              (voice over)
No. I don't know. I haven't told 
him about the garbage thing because 
I'm pissed off at him right now. 
He's letting some old college buddy 
stay at our house for a couple 
of days, and he didn't even ask 
me about it. I mean, I would've 
said yes, I just wish he would've 
asked.




                         What upsets you about that?


                         I guess I'm upset because I can't 
really justify being upset, I mean, 
it's his house, really, he pays 
the mortgage.


                         But he asked you to quit your job, 
and you do have housework.


                         Yeah, I know.


                         This unexpected visit 
notwithstanding, how are things 
with John?


                              (shrugs)
Fine, I guess. Except right now 
I m going through this where I 
don't want him to touch me.



               CYNTHIA BISHOP, Ann's SISTER, opens her door to reveal the
freshly coifed John Millaney. They kiss passionately and begin 
to disrobe. Cynthia bears a slight resemblance to Ann, but 
is not as overtly attractive. She does, however, have a definite 
carnal appeal and air of confidence that Ann lacks.


                              (voice over)
When did you begin having this feeling?


                              (voice over)
About a week ago. I don't know 
what brought it on, I just started 
feeling like I didn't want him 
to touch me.


                              (voice over, to Ann)
Prior to this feeling, were you 
comfortable having physical contact 
with him?


                              (voice over)
Oh, yeah.
(pause)
But see, I've never really been 
into sex that much, I mean, I like 
it and everything, it just does't 
freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, 
you know? But anyway, lately we 
haven't been doing anything at 
all. Like I said, it's not that 
I miss it, but I m curious the 
way things kind of slacked off 
all of a sudden.

               John and Cynthia are now having sex.


                              (voice over)
Perhaps he senses your hesitance 
at being touched.


                         (voice over)
But see, he stopped before I got 
that feeling, that's why it seems 
weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he 
wishes I would initiate things 
once in awhile, and I would 
except it never occurs to me, I'm 
always thinking about something 
else and then the few times that I 
have felt like starting something 
I was by myself.


                              (voice over) 
Did you do anything?

               A pause.


                              (voice over) 
What do you mean?


                              (voice over) 
Did you masturbate?




                              (taken aback) 
God, no.


                         I take it you've never masturbated?


                              (slightly uncomfortable) 
Well, I kind of tried once. It 
just seemed stupid, I kept seeing 
myself lying there and it seemed 
stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't 
know, and then I was wondering 
if my dead grandfather could see 
me doing this, and it just seemed 
like a dumb thing to be doing when 
we don't know what to do with all 
that garbage, you know?


                         So it was recently that you tried 
this.


                              (exhales, head down)
Well, kind of recently, I guess. 
But not too recently.

               There is a pause.


                         I'm really not up to having a guest 
in the house.



               John and Cynthia are lying in bed, bathed in sweat.


                         I've got to get back to the office.


                         I only get one today? Gee, how 
exciting.

               John rolls over and begins to put his clothes on.


                         I can't let my lunch hour go on 
too long. I've already skipped 
one meeting.


                         Don't give me this 
passive/aggressive bullshit. If 
you want to leave, leave. My life 
doesn't stop when you walk out the 
door, you know what I'm saying?

               John shakes his head.


                         Why don't you just tell me how
you really feel?

               John stands and begins putting on his clothes.


                         I have a friend coming in from 
out of town, I'll probably be 
spending some time with him the 
next couple of days.


                         Meaning we'll have to cool it for
awhile, right?


                         Right.

               A silent shrug from Cynthia. John is almost completely dressed.


                         I wish you'd quit that bartending
job.


                         Why?


                         I hate the thought of guys hitting
on you all the time.


                         I can handle it. Besides, the money 
is good and some of the guys are 
cute. And you are in no position 
to be jealous.


                         Who said I was jealous?


                         I did.

               John says nothing.


                         You know, I'd like to try your 
house sometime. The idea of doing 
it in my sister's bed gives me 
a perverse thrill.

               John thinks about that.


                         I wish I could tell everybody that 
Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, 
popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.


                         Could be risky.


                         Well, maybe I could just start 
a rumor, then.


                         No, I mean doing it at my house.


                         Afraid of getting caught?


                         Maybe.


                         You should be. Can I meet this 
friend of yours?


                         Cynthia, I don't think you want 
to, I mean, you should see the 
way he dresses. I really think 
he's in a bad way.


                         I'm intrigued.


                         You're intrigued?


                         Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm 
looking for. Then I won't have 
to fuck worried husbands all the 
time.

               John looks at her for a moment before heading for the door.


                         Bye.



               Graham has parked in the Millaney's driveway. He opens the 
trunk, revealing a Sony 8mm Video rig and a single black duffle 
bag. He grabs the duffle bag and shuts the trunk.

               Graham knocks at the door. He is stubbing out a cigarette with 
his beaten tennis shoe when Ann answers the door. She is unable 
to hide her suprise at his appearance.


                         Ann?


                         Yes?


                         (extends his hand) 
Graham Dalton.

               Ann shakes his hand.


                         Can I use your bathroom?

               Ann withdraws her hand.


                         Yes. Yes, come in, please.

               Graham moves inside.



               Ann closes the door and motions Graham to the rear of the house.


                         Straight back, first door on the 
left.

               Graham heads for the bathroom. Ann heads for the phone. She 
dials John's office.


                         Forman, Brent, and Millaney.


                         John Millaney, please. This is 
his wife.

               Graham exits the bathroom. Ann quickly hangs up the phone.


                         That was quick.


                         False alarm.


                         Oh. Well, please sit down.

               Graham sits, his manner pleasantly animated. He gets his Gitanes 
from inside his scuffed black leather jacket and looks around 
for an ashtray. Ann swallows uncomfortably.


                         We...don't usually let people smoke 
in the house. We have a patio if you --


                         Oh, no problem. It can wait.

               A moment of silence. Graham looks at Ann directly. It is not 
a challenging stare, he's just trying to ascertain what kind 
of person she is. Ann, to her credit, somehow meets his gaze. 
Something subtle passes between them.


                              (looks at duffle bag) 
Do you have other things?


                         Yes.
(pause)
Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, 
I have some other things, no, I 
don't need to bring them in. This 
is all I need to stay here.


                         Oh.

               Graham smiles. He has an unusual face, a face that fluctuates 
between remarkably handsome and just plain strange.


                         Have you ever been on television?


                         Televison?


                         Yes.


                         No. Why?


                              (shrugs) 
Curious.

               The central air-conditioning switches on. Ann smiles.


                         Graham is an unusual name.


                         Yeah, I guess it is. My mother 
is a complete Anglophile, anything 
British makes her drool like a 
baby. She probably heard the name 
in some movie. She's a prisoner 
of public television now.


                         Oh, uh-huh.


                         Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?


                              (downplaying)
No, I think you look...fine.


                              (smiles)
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable 
with my appearance. I feel a little 
out of place in these surroundings.


                         Well...


                         I used to take great pleasure in 
that, being purposefully different, 
rubbing people's noses in it. 
Didn't you do that when you were 
younger?


                              (thinks) 
No, not really.


                         Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band 
once, and the music was always 
secondary to just flat out 
offending as many people as 
possible.


                         You play an instrument?


                         No, I was in charge of kind of 
standing at the microphone and 
reciting these really depressing 
lyrics in a monotone. The whole 
thing was really .... irrelevant. 
How do you like being married?


                              (caught slightly off
guard)
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.


                         What about it do you like? I'm 
not being critical, I'd really 
like to know.


                         Well.....well, the clich about
the security of it, that's really 
true. We own a house, and I really 
like that, you know? And I like 
that John was just made junior 
partner, so he has a steady job 
and he's not some...

               Ann looks at Graham and stops. He smiles again.


                         ...free-lance. You know.


                         Yes. So you feel security, 
stability. Like things are going 
to last awhile.


                         Oh, definitely. I mean, just this 
past year has gone by like phew! 
I hardly even knew it passed.


                         Did you know that if you shut 
someone up in a room, and the only 
clock he has reference to runs 
two hours slow for every 
twenty-four, that his body will 
eventually adjust to that schedule? 
Simply because the mind honestly 
perceives that twenty-six hours 
are twenty-four, the body follows.
And then there are sections of time. 
Your life can be broken down into 
the sections of time that formed 
your personality (if you have one). 
For instance, when I was twelve,
I had an eleven minute conversation 
with my father that to this day 
defines our relationship. Now, 
I'm not saying that everything 
happened in that specific section 
of time, but the events of my 
childhood involving my father led 
up to, and then were crystallized 
in, that eleven minutes.

               Ann is fascinated, if a bit overwhelmed.


                         Oh, uh-huh.


                              (smiles)
Anyway, I think the mind is very 
flexible as far as time is 
concerned.


                         You mean like "time flies"?


                         Exactly. I would say the fact that 
you feel the first year of your 
marriage has gone by quickly means 
lots of things. Or could mean lots 
of things.


                         How long has it been since you've 
seen John?


                         Nine years.


                         Nine years?


                         Yes. I was surprised that he 
accepted when I asked if I could 
stay here until I found a place.


                         Why? Didn't you know him well?


                         I knew him very well. We were 
extremely close until I dropped 
out.

               A pause.


                         Why'd you drop out?


                         Oh, lots of reasons, most of them 
boring. But, up until I dropped 
out, John and I were...very much 
alike.


                         That's hard to believe. The two 
of you seem so different.


                         I would imagine that we are, now. 
I think I'm ready to use the 
bathroom, finally.

               Graham gets up and heads for the toilet. Ann watches him go,
a bemused smile on her face. After she hears the door close, 
she can't resist the impulse to take a closer look at Graham's 
bag.

               IN THE BATHROOM, Graham pokes around, looking through the 
medicine cabinet and sniffing towels.


                              (voice over) 
Call the cops.



               John, Ann and Graham are eating dinner.


                              (to Graham)
That's the first thing that ran 
through my mind when I saw you. 
I thought this is not the same 
man that rode the unicycle naked 
through the homecoming parade.


                              (to Graham) 
You did that?


                         Everybody has a past.


                              (smiles at Graham)
What do you think the Greeks would 
make of that outfit you're wearing?


                         A bonfire, probably.

               John takes a sip of Chivas.


                              (to Ann)
This food is excellent.


                         Thank you.


                         Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann 
has some serious salt action going. 
I keep telling her, you can always 
add more if you want, but you can't 
take it out.


                              (to Ann)
You have family here also?


                              (nods, chewing) 
Mother, father, sister.


                         Sister older or younger?


                         Younger.

               John takes a large swig of Chivas.


                         Are you close?

               Graham sees Ann and John exchange looks.


                         I'm sorry. Am I prying again?


                         You were prying before?


                         Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling 
Ann about your marriage this 
afternoon.


                              (smiles)
Really. How'd it go?


                         She held up very well.

               Ann laughs.


                              (to Ann)
So I was asking about your sister.

               Ann's smile fades. John resumes eating.


                         Oh, we get along okay. She's just 
very...she's an extrovert. I think 
she's loud. She probably wouldn't 
agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.


                              (to Graham)
Are you going to see Elizabeth 
while you re here?

               An almost imperceptible reaction by Graham.


                         I don't know.


                              (interested)
Who's Elizabeth?


                         Girl Graham dated. Still lives 
here, far as I know.

               Graham eats in silence.


                         Graham and I were talking about 
apartments and I told him to check 
the Garden District, there are 
some nice little places there, 
garage apartments and stuff.


                              (to Graham)
Stay away from the Garden District. 
Serious crime. I don't know what 
kind of place you're looking for, 
but there are a lot of studio-type 
apartments available elsewhere.


                         I wish I didn't have to live 
someplace.


                              (laughs) 
What do you mean?

               Graham thinks a moment, then puts his keyring with its single 
key onto the table.


                         Well, see, right now I have this 
one key, and I really like that. 
Everything I own is in my car. 
If I get an apartment, that's two 
keys. If I get a job, maybe I 
have to open and close once in 
awhile, that's more keys. Or I 
buy some stuff and I m worried 
about getting ripped off, so I 
get some locks, and that's more 
keys. I just really like having 
the one key. It's clean, you know?

               Graham looks at the keyring before returning it to his pocket.


                         Get rid of the car when you get 
your apartment, then you'll still 
have one key.


                         I like having the car, the car 
is important.


                         Especially if you want to leave 
someplace in a hurry.


                         Or go someplace in a hurry.

               Ann takes her plate into the kitchen.


                              (smiles at Graham) 
Do you pay taxes?

               Graham also stands, empty plate in hand.


                         Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay 
taxes, only a liar doesn't pay 
taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is 
the second lowest form of human 
being.


                              (from the kitchen) 
What's the first?


                         Lawyers.

               John smiles, thinking. Graham follows Ann into the kitchen. 
John shouts after them.


                         Hey, Ann, why don't you go with 
Graham to hunt for apartments? 
Show him how the city has changed.

               Ann looks at Graham.


                         Would you mind?


                         No.


                              (shouts back to John) 
Okay, I will!!

               John, sitting at the table and now toying with his keyring, 
nods.



               Everyone but Ann is asleep. She gets up from her bed and sneaks 
quietly into the guest bedroom where Graham is staying. She 
walks cautiously up to his bed to watch him as he sleeps. 
Moonlight caresses his face as he breathes peacefully. Exhaling, 
he turns over slowly, his back to Ann.

               She picks up his jacket from beside the bed and feels the 
surface. She brings the jacket to her nose, inhaling his 
presence. She then sets the jacket down.



               The phone rings. Cynthia answers.


                         Hello.


                         Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house 
in exactly one hour.


                         You are scum. I'll be there.



               Graham and Ann walk around the room, their footfalls heavy on 
the hardwood floors. MR. MILLER, the landlord, stands nearby. 
He looks fairly interested in Ann.


                         Plenty of room for two people.


                         It'll just be me.


                         Student?


                         No.
(pause)
You said three-fifty?


                         Plus first and last month deposit.


                         Will you lease month-to-month?


                         Not for three-fifty.


                         How about for five hundred?

               Mr. Miller looks at Ann, then back at Graham.


                         That I can do.



               Cynthia lets herself in. She looks around.


                         John?


                              (offscreen)
In here!!

               Cynthia walks to the bedroom, where John lies naked on the bed.
She smiles, kicking off her shoes.


                         Ain't you a picture.

               Cynthia begins taking her clothes off. She places her diamond
stud earring in her jacket pocket, and then drops the jacket
on the floor. She moves onto the bed with John.


                              (voice over)
Maybe you'll understand this,
because you know John, but he
confuses me sometimes.


                              (voice over)
How do you mean?



               Graham and Ann are having lunch. Ann looks to have had a lot
of wine. Graham drinks club soda with a twist.


                         It's hard to explain. It's like...
John treats everybody the same,
you know? I mean, he acts just
as excited about seeing somebody
he hardly knows as he does when
he sees me. And so I feel like,
what's different about me, if I'm
treated exactly the same as some
acquaintance? If I don't like
somebody, I don't act like I do.
I guess that's why a lot of people
think I'm a bitch.

               She takes a sip of wine.


                         Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not
saying I know people think you're
a bitch, I'm saying I know what
you mean. And I don't even know
that people think you're a bitch.
Do they?


                         I feel like they do.


                         Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really,
I wouldn't pay much attention.

               Ann smiles.


                         I know that I just don't feel a
connection with very many people,
so I don't waste time with people
I don't feel one with.


                         Right, right. I don't feel
connected to many people, either.
Other than John.

               Graham nods.


                         Can I tell you something personal?
I feel like I can. It's something
I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't,
anyway.


                         It's up to you. But I warn you,
if you tell me something personal,
I might do the same.


                         Okay. I think...I think sex is
overrated. I think people place
way too much importance on it.
And I think that stuff about women
wanting it just as bad is crap.
I m not saying women don't want
it, I just don't think they want
it for the reason men think they
do.
(smiles)
I'm getting confused.

               Graham smiles.


                         Do you understand what I'm trying
to say?


                         I think so. I remember reading
somewhere that men learn to love
what they're attracted to, whereas
women become more and more
attracted to the person they love.


                         Yes! Yes! I think that's very true.
Very.

               Graham watches Ann take a sip of wine.


                         So what about kids?


                         Kids? What about them?


                         Do you want them?


                         Yeah, actually, I do. But John
doesn't. At least not right now.


                         Why is that?


                         I don't know, he just said he wants
to wait. I quit asking.

               Graham nods.


                         So what's your personal thing?
Are you really going to tell me
something personal?


                         Do you want me to?


                         As long as it's not...gross, you
know? Like some scar or something.
It has to be like mine, like
something about you.


                         Agreed.

               Graham takes a sip of club soda.


                         I'm impotent.

               Ann looks at him closely.


                         You're what?


                         Impotent.


                         You are?


                         Well, let me put it this way: I
cannot achieve an erection while
in the presence of another person.
So, for all practical purposes,
I am impotent.

          Ann takes a large sip of wine. Graham lights a cigarette.


                         Does it bother you?


                              (exhales)
Not usually. I mean, honestly,
I haven't known many guys that
could think straight with an
erection, so I feel I'm way ahead
of the game as far as being
clear-headed goes.


                         Well...are you self-conscious about
it?


                         I am self-conscious, but not in
the same way that you are. You
have got to be the most attractive
self-conscious person I've ever
seen.


                         Why do you say I'm self-conscious?


                         Well, I've been watching you. I've
watched you eat, I've watched you
speak, I've watched the way you
move, and I see somebody who is
extremely conscious of being looked
at. I think you really believe
that people are looking at you
all the time. And you know what?


                         What?


                         They are looking at you. Ann, you
are truly breathtaking. I don't
know if you understand how your
appearance can affect people. Men
want to possess you, women wish
they looked like you. And those
that don't or can't resent you.
And the fact that you're a nice
person just makes it worse.


                              (thinks)
My therapist said that--


                         You're in therapy?


                         Aren't you?


                         Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used
to be, but the therapist I had
was really ineffectual in helping
me deal with my problems. Of
course, I lied to him constantly,
so I guess I can't hold him totally
responsible...


                         So you don't believe in therapy?


                         I believe in it for some people.
I mean, for me it was silly, I
was confused going in. So I just
formed my own personal theory that
you should never take advice from
someone of the opposite sex that
doesn't know you intimately.


                         Well, my therapist knows me
intimately.


                              (surprised)
You had sex with you therapist?


                         Of course not.


                         Oh, see, I meant someone you've
had sex with. That's part of the
theory.


                         Excuse me for asking, but how would
you know?
                                   GRAHAM
                              (smiles)
Well, I wasn't always impotent.

               Ann takes another sip of wine and thinks for a moment.


                         Now, you said never take advice
from someone that you don't know
intimately, right?


                         Basically, yes.



               Cynthia is leaving the house. She gives John a big kiss.


                              (voice over)
So since I've never had sex with
you, by your own advice I shouldn't
accept your advice.


                              (voice over)
That's correct.
(pause)
Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?

               Cynthia is not wearing her diamond stud earring.




                         Well, I don't know. The week
started off okay, but then I was
outside watering the plants, and
I started feeling dizzy from the
heat and that got me thinking about
the Greenhouse Effect, so I went
inside and turned on the
air-conditioner full blast, and
that made me feel a little better
until I started thinking about
radon leakage coming up through
the floor, and--


                         Radon leakage?


                         Yes, it's this radioactive gas
in the ground, and houses kind
of act like magnets to pull it
up, and--you've never heard of
this?


                         No, I haven't.


                         Well, the cumulative effect is
not good, let me tell you.
(pause)
I knew I shouldn't have watered
those plants.


                         Did you confront John about the
visitor?


                         What visitor?


                         The friend of John's that was
staying at your house.


                         Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to
him about that. Actually, that
turned out to be pretty
interesting. I expected Graham
to be this...well, like John, you
know? I mean, he said they had
gone to school together, so I was
expecting lots of stories about
getting drunk and secret handshakes
and stuff. But he turned out to
be this...this kind of character,
I mean, he's kind of arty but okay,
you know?


                         Is he still at your house?


                         No, he left last week.


                         Did you find him attractive?


                         What do you mean, like physically?


                         Let me rephrase. Were you attracted
to him?


                              (thinks)
I guess, but not because of the
way he looked or anything. He's
just so different, somebody new
to have a conversation with. I'm
just tired of talking to other
couples about whether or not
they're going to buy the station
wagon, you know? It's just boring.
I don't know, he was just
different. And he's really on about
truth a lot, being honest, and
I like that, I felt comfortable
around him.
(pause)
After he left I had a dream that
he signed a lease to rent our guest
room.


                              (voice over)
So where's he from?



               Ann stands watching Cynthia get dressed for work.


                         I don't know. He went to school
here, then he was in New York for
awhile, then Philadelphia, and
then just kind of travelling
around.


                         Must be nice. So, what's he like,
is he like John?


                         No, not at all. Actually, I don't
think John likes him much anymore.
He said he thought Graham had
gotten strange.

               A pause.


                         Is he? Strange, I mean?


                         Not really. Maybe if I just saw
him on the street I'd have said
that, but after talking to
him...he's just kind of...I don't
know, unusual.


                         Uh-huh. So what's he look like?


                         Why?


                         I just want to know what he looks
like, is all.


                         Why, so you can go after him?


                         Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just
asked what he looked like.

               Ann says nothing.


                         Besides, even if I decided to fuck
his brains out, what business is
that of yours?


                         Do you have to say that?


                         What?


                         You know what. You say it just
to irritate me.


                         I say it because it's descriptive.


                         Well, he doesn't strike me as the
kind of person that would go in
for that sort of thing, anyway.


                         Ann, you always underestimate me.


                         Well, I wonder why.


                         I think you're afraid to put the
two of us in the same room
together. I think you're afraid
he'll be undeniably drawn to me.


                         Oh, for God's sake. Really,
Cynthia, really, I don't think
he's your type.


                         "My type"? What is this bullshit?
How would you know what "my type"
is?


                         I have a pretty good idea.


                         Ann, you don't have a clue. Look,
I don't even know why we're
discussing this, I'll just call
him myself.


                         He doesn't have a phone.


                         Well, I'll call him when he does.


                         But he won't.


                         What are you talking about?


                         He's not getting a phone, he
doesn't like talking on the phone.


                         Oh, please. Okay,' so give me the
Zen master's address, I'll think
of a reason to stop by.


                         Let me talk to him first.


                         Why? Just give me the address,
you won't even have to be involved.


                         I don't feel right just giving
you the address so that you can
go over there and...


                         And what?


                         And...do whatever it is you do.

               Cynthia laughs loudly. Ann, not happy, watches her dig through
the jewelry box.


                         Lose something?


                         That goddam diamond stud earring
that cost me a fucking fortune.


                         Are you getting Mom something for
her birthday?


                         I don't know, I'll get her a card
or something.


                         A card? For her fiftieth birthday?


                         What's wrong with that?


                         Don't you think she deserves a
little more than a card? I mean,
the woman gave birth to you. It s
her fiftieth birthday--


                         Will you stop? Jesus.


                         I just thought it might--


                         Okay, Ann, okay. How about this:
you buy her something nice, and
I'll pay for half. All right?


                         Fine.


                         Good. Now, if you'll pardon me,
I have to go to work.




                         I was thinking maybe I shouldn't
be in therapy anymore.


                         What brought this on?


                         I've been thinking about it for
awhile, and then I was talking
to somebody who kind of put things
in perspective for me.


                              (smiles)
I thought that's what I did. Who
was it that you talked to?


                         That guy Graham I told you about.
He said taking advice from someone
you don't know intimately
was...well, he said a lot of stuff.

               The Doctor exhales, thinking for a moment.


                         Ann, in life one has to be aware
of hidden agendas.
(pause)
Did it occur to you that Graham
may have his own reasons for not
wanting you to be in therapy?


                         What do you mean? I don't
understand.


                         It's possible that Graham has
hidden motives for disliking
therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps
he has problems of his own that
he is unwilling to deal with, and
he would like to see other people,
you for instance, wallow in their
situation just as he does. Do you
think that's possible?


                         I guess.


                         You understand that you are free
to leave therapy at any time?


                         Yes.


                         That you are under no obligation
to me?


                         Yes.


                         Do you want to leave therapy?


                         Not really.


                         Do you feel there is more progress
to be made?


                         Yes.


                         I'm glad you feel that way, because
I feel that way, too.


                         But you don't have hidden motives
for feeling that way, right?

               The Doctor laughs. Ann does not laugh with him.



               On a television monitor we see images originating from an 8mm
Video deck. Graham sits naked in a sheet-covered chair facing
the screen. He watches the tape, which is footage of himself
interviewing a girl about her sexual preferences. The
photography on the tape is handheld, relentless. As the
questions get more detailed, Graham becomes more aroused.

               There is a knock on Graham's door. He calmly shuts off the
videotape player and stands, wrapping the sheet around himself.


                         It's open.

               Graham walks into the bedroom to put on some clothes. Ann opens
the door and walks into the apartment.


                         Hi!


                              (off)
Ann. Hello.


                         Are you in the middle of something?


                              (off)
Nothing I can't finish later.


                              (looks)
I just wanted to see how the place
looked furnished.


                              (Off)
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm
sort of cultivating a minimalist
vibe.


                         Somehow I imagined books. I thought
you would have like a whole lot
of books and be reading all the
time.

               Graham enters.


                         I do read a lot. But I check
everything out of the library.

               Graham picks up an Anais Nin diary and opens it to show Ann
the library sleeve inside.


                         Cheaper that way. And cuts down
on the clutter.

               Ann walks to the table where the video gear is set up. Graham
watches her closely. She looks into a large box of 8mm
videotapes. On the side of each tape is a label. The labels
look like this:



               And so on. There are thirty or forty tapes, total.


                         What are these?


                         Videotapes.


                              (smiles)
I can see that. What are they?

               Graham exhales.


                         It's a personal project I'm working
on.


                         What kind of personal project?


                         Oh, just a personal project like
anyone else's personal project.
Mine's just a little more personal.


                         Who's Donna?


                         Donna?


                         Donna. On this tape it says
"Donna".


                              (thinking)
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.


                         You went out with her?


                         Not really.

               Ann looks in the box again.


                         How come all these are girl's
names?

               Graham thinks for a moment.


                         Because I enjoy interviewing women
more than men.


                         All of these are interviews?


                         Yes.


                         Can we look at one?


                         No.


                         Why not?


                         Because I promised each subject
that no one would look at the tape
except me.

               Ann looks at Graham for a long moment, then back at the tapes.


                         What...what are these interviews
about?


                         The...interviews are about sex,
Ann.


                         About sex?


                         Yes.


                         What about sex?


                         Everything about sex.


                         Like what?


                         Like what they've done, what they
do, what they don't do, what they
want to do but are afraid to ask
for, what they won't do even if
asked. Anything I can think of.


                         You just ask them questions?


                         Yes.


                         And they just answer them?


                         Mostly. Sometimes they do things.


                         To you?


                         No, not to me, for me, for the
camera.


                              (stunned)
I don't ...why...why do you do
this?


                         I'm sorry this came up.


                         This is just...so...


                         Maybe you want to go.


                         Yes, I do.

               Ann nods and absently heads for the door. She gives Graham a
puzzled look before leaving.



               Ann is talking to Cynthia on the telephone.


                              (still shaken)
I don't...he doesn't want you to
come over.


                         What do you mean he doesn't want
me to come over? Did you tell him
about me?


                         No, I didn't.


                         Why not?


                         Because I never got around to it.


                         Well, why?


                         Because. Cynthia, look, John was
right. Graham is strange. Very
strange. You don't want to get
involved with him.


                         What the hell happened over there?
Did he make a pass at you?


                         No!


                         Then what's the story, what's this
"strange" bullshit all of a sudden?
Is he drowning puppies, or what?


                         No, it's nothing like that.


                         Well, what? Is he dangerous?


                         No, he's not dangerous. Not
physically.


                         Well, what, then?


                         I don't want to talk about it.


                         Then why'd you call me?


                         I don't know.

               Ann hangs up.



               Cynthia gets out of the shower. The phone rings. She wraps
herself in a towel and lifts the receiver.


                         Hello.


                         Cynthia. John.


                         Not today. I've got other plans.


                         Oh.
(pause)
Well, when, then?


                         How about inviting me over to
dinner?


                         You know what I mean.


                         Yeah, I know what you mean.

               Cynthia hangs up the phone.



               Graham sits smoking a cigarette. There is a knock at his door.


                         It's open.

               Cynthia enters. Graham looks up at her.


                         Who are you?


                         I'm Cynthia Bishop.


                         Do I know you?


                         I'm Ann Millaney's sister.


                         The extrovert.


                              (smiles)
She must have been in a good mood
when she said that. She usually
calls me loud.


                         She called you that, too. May I
ask why you re here?


                         You want me to leave?


                         I just want to know why you're
here.


                         Well, like I said, Ann is my
sister. Sisters talk. You can
imagine the rest.


                         No, I really can't. I find it
healthy never to characterize
people I don't know or
conversations I haven't heard.
I don't know what you and your
sister discussed about me or
anything else. Last time I saw
Ann she left here very...confused,
I would say. And upset.


                         She still is.


                         And are you here to berate me for
making her that way?


                         Nope.


                         She didn't tell you why she was
upset?


                         Nope.


                         She didn't give you my address?


                         Nope.


                         How did you find me?


                         I, uh, know a guy at the power
company.


                         I don't understand. Why did you
want to come here? I mean, I can't
imagine Ann painted a very
flattering portrait of me.


                         Well, I don't really listen to
her when it comes to men. I mean,
look at John, for crissake. Oh,
you went to school with him didn't
you? You're probably friends or
something.


                         Nope. I think the man is a liar.


                              (smiles)
I think you're right. So come on,
I came all the way over here to
find out what got Ann so spooked,
tell me what happened.


                              (smiles)
Spooked.

               He motions to the box of videotapes.


                         That box of tapes is what got Ann
so "spooked".

               Cynthia goes over to the box and looks inside for a long moment,
studying the labels.


                         Oh, okay. I think I get it.


                         What do you get?


                         Well, they must be something
sexual, because Ann gets freaked
out by that shit. Are these tapes
of you having sex with these girls
or something?


                         Not exactly.


                         Well, either you are or you aren't.
Which is it?


                         Why don't you let me tape you?


                         Doing what?


                         Talking.


                         About what?


                         Sex. Your sexual history, your
sexual preferences.


                         What makes you think I'd discuss
that with you?


                         Nothing.


                         You just want to ask me questions?


                         I just want to ask you questions.


                         And that's all?


                         That's all.


                              (a crooked smile)
Is this how you get off or
something? Taping women talking
about their sexual experiences?


                         Yes.


                         Would anybody else see the tape?


                         Absolutely not. They are for my
private use only.


                         How do we start?


                         I turn on the camera. You start
talking.


                         And you ask questions, right?


                         Yes.


                         How long will it take?


                         That depends on you. One woman
only used three minutes. Another
filled up three two hour tapes.


                         Can I see some of the other tapes
to get an idea of what--


                         No.


                              (thinks)
Do I sit or stand?


                         Whichever you prefer.


                         I'd rather sit. Are you ready?


                         Just a moment.

               Graham grabs his 8mm Video camera, puts in a new tape, and turns
it on.


                         I am now recording. Tell me your
name.


                         Cynthia Patrice Bishop.


                         Describe for me your first sexual
experience.


                         My first sexual experience or the
first time I had intercourse?


                         Your first sexual experience.


                              (thinks)
I was...eight years old. Michael
Green, who was also eight, asked
if he could watch me take a pee.
I said he could if I could watch
him take one, too. He said okay,
and then we went into the woods
behind our house. I got this
feeling he was chickening out
because he kept saying, "Ladies
first!" So I pulled down my
underpants and urinated, and he
ran away before I even finished.


                         Was it ever a topic of conversation
between the two of you afterward?


                         No. He kind of avoided me for the
rest of the summer, and then his
family moved away. To Cleveland,
actually.


                         How unfortunate. So when did you
finally get to see a penis?


                         When I was fourteen.


                         Live, or in a photograph or film
of some sort?


                         Very much live.


                         What did you think? Did it look
like you expected?


                         Not really. I didn't picture it
with veins or ridges or anything,
I thought it would be smooth, like
a test tube.


                         Were you disappointed?


                         No. If anything, after I looked
at it awhile, it got more
interesting. It had character,
you know?


                         What about when you touched it?
What did you expect it to feel
like, and then what did it really
feel like?


                         It was warmer than I thought it
would be, and the skin was softer
than it looked. It's weird.
Thinking about it now, the organ
itself seemed like a separate
thing, a separate entity to me.
I mean, after he pulled it out
and I could look at it and touch
it, I completely forgot that there
was a guy attached to it. I
remember literally being startled
when the guy spoke to me.


                         What did he say?


                         He said that my hand felt good.


                         Then what happened?


                         Then I started moving my hand,
and then he stopped talking.



               Cynthia, adjusting her clothes, opens the door to leave. She
looks very aroused. She and Graham do not speak or touch.



               John Millaney picks up a telephone and presses a blinking
button.


                         John Millaney.


                         I want to see you.


                         When?


                         Right now.


                         Jesus, I don't know if I can get
away. I've got a client waiting.
I'd have to do some heavy duty
juggling.


                         Then get those balls in the air
and get your butt over here.

               She hangs up. John thinks a moment, then hits his intercom
button.


                         Janet, re-schedule Kirkland, see
if he can come in Friday. Smooth
things out, tell him an emergency
came up. I'll slip out the back.



               Graham watches Cynthia's tape, becoming excited.


                              (voice on tape)
Would you like me to take my pants
off?


                              (voice on tape)
If you wish.
(pause)
You're not wearing any underwear.


                              (voice on tape)
Do you like the way I look?


                              (voice on tape)
Yes.


                              (voice On tape)
Do you think I'm pretty?


                              (voice on tape)
Yes.


                              (voice on tape)
Prettier than Ann?


                              (voice on tape)
Different.



               Cynthia and John are having sex.


                              (to Graham, voice on
tape)
John doesn't have sex with Ann
anymore.


                              (voice On tape)
Is that what he tells you?


                              (voice on tape)
He doesn't have to tell me.

               Cynthia has an intense orgasm. She rolls off of John, sweating.


                         Jesus Christ. You are on fire
today.

               Cynthia smiles.


                         Yes. You can go now.


                              (voice over)
If you won't talk to me, I can't
help you.

               A moment of silence. John is starting to put his clothes on.
Cynthia lies in bed, her eyes closed, her face serene.


                              (voice over)
I hate my sister.




                         Why?


                              (rambling)
Because all she thinks about are
these guys she's after and I just
hate her she's such a little slut
I thought that in high school and
I think that now. Why do people 
have to be so obsessed with sex all 
what's the big damn deal? I mean,
it's okay and everything, but I
don't understand when people let
it control them, control their
lives, why do they do that?



               Ann lies awake in bed beside John, who is sound asleep.


                              (voice over)
There are many things that can
exert control over one's life,
good and bad. Religion, greed,
philanthropy, drugs.


                              (voice over)
I know, but this...I just feel
like everybody I know right now
is obsessed with sex.

               Ann looks over at John. She slowly reaches under the covers
and grasps his penis. Without waking, he rolls over and turns
his back to her. She returns to looking at the ceiling.


                         (voice over)
Except John, I guess.



               Ann is talking to Cynthia on the phone. Ann looks very morose.


                         He just asked me questions.


                         What kinds of questions?


                         Questions about sex.


                         Well, like what did he ask,
exactly?

               A pause.


                         Well, like, I don't want to tell
you, exactly.


                         Oh, so you'll let a total stranger
record your sexual life on tape,
but you won't tell your own sister?


                         Apparently.


                         Did he ask you to take your clothes
off?


                         Did he ask me to take my clothes
off? No, he didn't.


                         Did you take your clothes off?


                         Yes, I did.


                              (floored)
Cynthia!


                         What!?


                         Why did you do that?


                         Because I wanted to.


                         But why did you want to?


                         I wanted him to see me.


                         Cynthia, who knows where that tape
may end up? He could be...bouncing
it off some satellite or something.
Some horny old men in South America
or something could be watching
it.


                         He wouldn't do that.


                         You don't know that for sure.


                         Well, it's too late now, isn't
it?


                         Did he touch you?


                         No, but I did.


                         You touched him?


                         No, I touched me.


                         Wait a minute. Do you mean...don't
tell me you...in front of him.


                         In front of him, Ann, yes.


                              (serious)
You are in trouble.


                              (laughs)
Listen to you!! You sound like
Mom. What are you talking about?


                              (outraged)
I can t believe you did that!!


                         Why?


                         I mean, I couldn't do that in front
of John, even.


                         You couldn't do it, period.


                         You know what I mean, you don't
even know him!


                         I feel like I do.


                         That doesn't mean you do. You can't
possibly trust him, 
he's...perverted.


                         He's harmless. He just sits around
and looks at these tapes. What's
the big deal?


                         So he's got this catalogue of women
touching themselves? That doesn't
make you feel weird?


                         No. I don't think they all did
what I did.


                         You are in serious trouble.


                         Ann, I don't understand why this
freaks you out so much. You didn't
do it, I did, and if it doesn't
bother me, why should it bother
you?


                         I don't want to discuss it.


                         Then why do you keep asking about
it?



               A sparse daytime crowd. Cynthia serves a beer to some DUDE.
He puts the money down on the bar and looks at her.


                              (as Marlon Brando)
Are you an assassin?


                         Excuse me?


                              (still Brando)
You're an errand boy...sent by
grocery clerks...to collect a bill.

               Ann enters the lounge, carrying a package.


                              (to Cynthia)
Brando, it's Brando, come on.


                         It's great. Pardon me.

               Cynthia moves down the bar to meet Ann.


                         I wish you'd get an answering
machine.


                         There's a phone here.


                         It was busy.

               Ann opens the package, revealing a lovely sun dress.


                         Here it is.


                         What is it?


                         It's a sun dress.


                         It looks like a tablecloth.


                         It does not.


                         Well, why would she want a sun
dress? She's got spots on her
shoulders and varicose veins.


                         So will you, someday.


                         Yeah, and when I do, I won't be
wearing sun dresses.

               The lounge phone rings.


                         I was just trying to--


                         Hold on.

               Cynthia walks to the other end of the bar to answer the phone.
The Dude watches her pass. Then he turns to Ann and gives her
the once-over. He spots the present.


                         Nice dress.

               Ann says nothing.


                         Wanna hear my Walter Matthau?
You'll love this.
(as Matthau)
"Feeelix, what are you, craaazee?"
(back to normal)
Pretty good, huh?

               Cynthia picks up the phone.


                         Hello.


                         Cynthia. John.


                         Well, this is timely. Your wife
is here, would you like to speak
to her?


                         She's there? What's she doing
there?


                         She came by to show me a present
that she and I are buying for your
mother-in-law.


                         Oh. When can I see you?


                         I don't know. I'm not sure I can
duplicate the level of intensity
I had the other day.


                         Nothing wrong with trying.


                         I don't think my sister would
agree.

               A pause.


                         Do you want me to stop calling?


                         Look, I'll call you, okay?

               Cynthia hangs up and walks back to Ann.


                         So what's my share of the dress?


                         Thirty-two dollars.

               Cynthia pulls thirty-five bucks out of her jeans. She watches
Ann put the money away.


                         Look, don't worry about the dress,
I'm sure she'll love it.


                              (to Ann and Cynthia)
Hey!! How about Tom Brokaw? Nobody
does Brokaw.
(as Tom Brokaw)
"In Iran today..."





               Graham sits reading a book. There is a knock at his door.


                         It s open.

               Cynthia enters the room, looking very intent on something.


                         Hello.


                         Hi.

               Graham sets his book down. He looks at her for a moment, then
drags on his cigarette.


                         Look, I'm just going to come right
out and tell you why I'm here,
okay?


                         Okay.


                         I'd like to make another tape.

               Graham thinks for a moment.


                         No.


                         No? Not even one more?


                         I never do more than one. I'm
sorry.


                         I can't talk you into it?


                         No. You'll have to get somebody
else.


                         Now who the hell is going to do
that for me?


                         I'm sure a substantial number of
men in this town would volunteer.


                         But I want you to do it, I want
somebody who will ask the right
questions and everything, somebody
I can play to and feel safe because
you can't do anything.


                         Ouch. Okay, I deserved that.
Cynthia, don't you understand?
After the first time it's just
not spontaneous. There's no edge
anymore. Look at the tapes, there
is only one date on each label.
I have never taped anyone twice.


                         So make an exception.


                         No.


                         How about if you record over the
one we already made? You could
have the same date and not use
another tape. Who would know?


                         I would.


                         Well, what the hell am I supposed
to do?


                         Cynthia, I don't know.


                         I can't believe you're doing this
after I let you tape me.


                         I'm sorry. I can't do it.


                         Goddamit, give me my tape, then.


                         No.

               Cynthia heads for the tape box. Graham leaps up to stop her.


                              (digging through the
box)
It's my fucking tape, you asshole--

               Graham grabs her wrists momentarily.


                              (heated)
No!! I told you what the parameters
were and you agreed. It's my tape.
I look at it, I touch it, nobody
else.

               Cynthia and Graham look at each other for a long moment.


                         Please go, I'd like you to go now.

               Cynthia looks at him.


                         Sure, okay.

               She leaves.



               John and Ann lie in bed. The lights are out. Ann is wide awake,
while John is on the verge of sleep. He rolls over and puts his
arm around her. She gets up and sits in a chair opposite the
bed.


                         John?


                         Mmmmm...


                         I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and
they said you weren't in. Do you
remember where you were?





               John and Cynthia are in Cynthia's bed, kissing. On the floor,
John's watch reads 3:11 pm.






                         Tuesday. I had a late lunch.


                         Did you see a message to call me
when you got back in?





               John leaves Cynthia's house and drives straight home, greeting
Ann as he steps through the front door.






                         Yes. I just got busy.


                         That's interesting, because I
didn't leave a message.

               John is waking up a little.


                         Then maybe I saw an old message.
There are a lot of them on my desk,
you know.


                         Who'd you have lunch with?


                         I ate by myself.

               A pause.


                         Something wrong?


                         Are you having an affair?


                         Jesus Christ, where'd that come
from? I have a late lunch by
myself and now I'm fucking
somebody?


                         Well, are you?


                         No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended
at the accusation.


                         If I'm right, I want to know.
I don't want you to lie. I'd be
very upset, but not as upset as
if I'd found out you'd been lying.


                         There's nothing to know, Ann.


                         I can't tell you how upset I would
be if you were lying.


                         Ann, you are completely paranoid.
Not ten minutes ago I wanted to
make love for the first time in
weeks, and you act like I'm dipped
in shit. You know, I think there
are a lot of women that would be
glad to have a young, straight
male making a pretty good living
beside them in bed with a hard
on.


                         My sister, for one. Is that who
it is?


                         For God's sake, Ann, I am not
fucking your sister. I don't find
her that attractive, for one.


                         Is that supposed to comfort me?


                         I was just saying, you know? I
didn't get paranoid when you didn't
want to make love. I could have
easily assumed that you didn't
want to because you were having
an affair.


                         But I'm not.


                         I'm not either!!


                         Why don't I believe you?


                         Look, this conversation is utterly
ridiculous. Maybe when you have
some evidence, we should talk,
but don't give me conjecture and
intuition.


                         Always the lawyer.


                         Goddam right. I mean, can you
imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive
this man is guilty. I can't place
him at the scene or establish a
motive, but I have this really
strong feeling."


                         You've made your point.


                         I'm sorry. It's just...I'm under
a lot of pressure with this
Kirkland thing, it's my first big
case as junior partner, and I work
all day, I come home, I look
forward to seeing you, and...it
hurts that you accuse me like that.

               A pause. Ann exhales.


                         I'm sorry, too. I...I get these
ideas in my head, you know, and
I have nothing to do all day but
sit around and concoct these
intricate scenarios. And then
I want to believe it so I don't
think I've wasted the whole day.
Last week I was convinced you were
having an affair with Cynthia,
I don't know why.


                         I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia,
of all people. She's so...


                         Loud.


                         Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.


                         I didn't say it was rational, I
just said I was convinced.


                         Isn't therapy helping at all?


                         I don't know. Sometimes I feel
stupid babbling about my little
problems while children are
starving in the world.


                         Quitting your therapy won't feed
the children of Ethiopia.


                         I know.

               A pause.


                         You never used to say "fucking".





               John sits on the edge of Cynthia's bed, slowly undressing.


                         It's just so blatantly stupid,
I have a hard time believing you
did it.


                         What's so stupid about it?


                         That you...you don't even know
the guy.


                         Well, you know him, he's a friend
of yours, do you think he can be
trusted?


                         Shit, after what you've told me,
I don't know. I should've known,
when he showed up dressed like
some arty brat.


                         I like the way he dresses.


                         What if this tape gets into the
wrong hands?


                         "The wrong hands"? We're not
talking about military secrets,
John. They're just tapes that he
makes so he can sit around and
get off.


                         Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have
sex with any of them? They just
talk?


                         Right.


                         Jesus. I could almost understand
it if he was screwing these people,
almost. Why doesn't he just buy
some magazines or porno movies
or something?


                         Doesn't work. He has to know the
people, he has to be able to
interact with them.


                         Interact, fine, but did you have
to masturbate in front of him,
for God's sake? I mean...

               A pause.


                         I felt like it, so what? Goddam,
you and Ann make such a big deal
out of it.


                         You told Ann about this?


                         Of course. She is my sister. I
tell her almost everything.


                         I wish you hadn't done that.


                         Why not?


                         It's just something I'd prefer
she didn't know about.


                         She's a grown-up, she can handle
it.


                         I just...Ann is very...


                         Hung up.


                         It just wasn't a smart thing to
do. Did you sign any sort of
paper, or did he have any contract
with you saying he wouldn't
broadcast these tapes?


                         No.


                         You realize you have no recourse
legally? This stuff could show
up anywhere.


                         It won't. I trust him.


                              (disbelieving)
You trust him.


                         Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more
than I trust you.


                         What do you mean?


                         Exactly what I said. I'd trust
him before I'd trust you. How much
clearer can I be?


                         It hurts that you would say that
to me.


                              (laughs)
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're
fucking your wife's sister and
you hardly been married a year.
You're a liar. But at least I know
you're a liar. It's the people that 
don't know, like Ann, that have to 
watch out.


                         By definition you're lying to Ann,
too.


                         That's right. But I never took
a vow in front of God and everybody
to be "faithful" to my sister.


                         Look, are we going to do it or
not?


                         Actually, no, I've changed my mind.
I shouldn't have called.


                              (ingratiating)
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to
do something...


                         How about straightening up the
living room?

               John doesn't smile.


                         Come on, John. You should be happy,
we've gone this far without Ann
finding out, I'm making it real
easy on you. Just walk out of here
and I'll see you at your house
for a family dinner sometime.


                         Did he put you up to this?


                         Who?


                         Graham.


                         No, he didn't put me up to this.
Jesus, I don't need people to tell
me what I should do. I've just
been thinking about things, that's
all.


                         I can't believe I let him stay
in my house. Right under my nose.
That deviant fucker was right under
my nose and I didn't see him.


                         If he had been under your prick
you'd have spotted him for sure.


                              (looks at her)
God, you...you're mean.


                         I know. Will you please leave now?


                         Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe
I want to talk.


                         John, we have nothing to talk
about.


                         I knew it, I knew it. Things are
getting complicated.


                         No, John, things are getting real
simple.



               Ann, dressed in some of John's work clothes (old cotton shirt,
khaki pants) is cleaning the house. Not cleaning like a normal
person, but like an obsessive/compulsive person. Scrubbing spots
that are already clean, vacuuming the same area of rug over
and over, etc. Suddenly, an object lodges itself in the snout
of the vacuum cleaner, making a loud noise. Shutting the machine
off, Ann turns it over and sees that Cynthia's diamond stud
earring has gotten hooked in the take-up roller.

               Ann stares at Cynthia's earring for a long moment.



               Cynthia picking up her jacket from beside the bed after having
sex with John. The earring slips out of the pocket and bounces
under the edge of the bed.



               Ann as she sets the earring onto the floor and begins to pound
it with the bottom of a water glass, trying to smash it to
pieces. She soon realizes the futility of trying to break a
diamond.

               Ann looks down at herself. Suddenly realizing that she is
dressed in John's clothing, she frantically rips the shirt and
pants from her body as though the material were burning her
skin. Popped buttons skid across the floor.

               Clothed only in her bra and underwear, Ann sits in the middle
of the bedroom floor, arms around herself.



               Ann, now in jeans and t-shirt, stumbles to her car. Once inside,
she jams the key into the ignition and rests her head against
the steering wheel.



               Ann lifts her head from the steering wheel and looks up. She
looks almost surprised to find that she has driven to Graham's.
Slowly, she gets out of the car.



               Graham sits reading.

               There is a weak knock at the door. Graham listens, not sure he
heard anything. There is a second weak knock.


                         It's open!

               Nothing happens. Graham gets up and opens the door himself.
Ann stands against the wall of the hallway, her head down, her
breathing deliberate. Concerned, Graham slowly begins to lead
her inside. Impulsively, she hugs him tightly.

               Unaccustomed to physical contact, Graham's hands hang awkwardly
at his side. Ann slowly pulls back from the embrace and sits
down. Graham goes to the kitchen area and gets her a glass of
water. He gives it to her and sits in the chair opposite. Ann
holds the glass in her hand, staring at it.


                         It's bottled, not tap.

               A weak smile from Ann. She drinks, swallowing with difficulty.


                         I'm not sure why I came here. I
had kind of decided not to talk
to you after...you know.


                         I know.

               A pause.


                         That son of a bitch.

               Ann looks at Graham.


                              (sarcastic)
John and Cynthia have been...
"fucking".


                         I know.


                              (stunned)
You know?


                         Yes.


                         How did you know?


                         She said it on her tape.


                              (angry)
Why didn't you tell me?


                         Ann, when would I have told you?
We were not speaking, if you
recall.

               Ann says nothing.


                         But even if we had been speaking,
I wouldn't have told you.


                         Why not?


                         It's not my place to tell you these
things, Ann. You have to find out
by yourself or from John directly.
You have to trust me on this.

               Ann shakes her head.


                         My life is...shit. It's all shit.
It's like somebody saying, "Okay,
chairs are not chairs, they're
actually swimming pools" I mean,
nothing is what I thought it was.
What happened to me? Have I been
asleep? I vaguely remember the
wedding, but a lot of it is just
a blur...like I was watching
from a distance. I can't believe
him. Why didn't I trust my
intuition?

               Graham says nothing.


                         And I'm vacuuming his goddam rug.
His rug, that he paid to have put
in his house. Nothing in that place
belongs to me. I wanted to put
some of my grandmother's furniture
in it, but he wouldn't let me.
So I m vacuuming his rug. That
bastard.

               Ann looks at Graham.


                         I want to make a tape.

               A pause.


                         Do you think that's such a good
idea?


                         Don't you want to make one?


                         Yes. But I sense the element of
revenge here.


                         What difference does it make why
I do it?


                         I want you to be aware of what
you're doing and why, because I
know that this is not the sort
of thing you would do in a normal
frame of mind.


                         What would you know about a normal
frame of mind?


                         (impressed)
That's a good question.


                         What do you have to do to get
ready?


                         Load a new tape, turn the camera
on.


                         Then do it.

               Graham opens a new box of videotapes.


                         How do you pay for all this? I
mean, rent, and tapes and this
equipment.


                         I have money.


                         What will you do when the money
runs out?


                         It won't. Are you ready?


                         Yes.

               Graham turns the camera on.


                         Tell me your name.


                         Ann Bishop Millaney.







               Street lights are illuminated. Night is imminent.



               Graham stops the video recorder. The record meter is stopped at
               46:02.

               Ann sits beside Graham on the couch. She looks into his eyes,
stroking his hair.

               After a moment, she gets up to leave.



               John is talking on the phone as Ann walks through the door.
He mumbles an apology into the receiver and hangs up as Ann
moves to the couch, her expression calm.


                              (worried)
Jesus Christ! What the hell
happened? I came home and 
your car was gone, the door 
was open, I thought for sure 
you'd been abducted by some mad 
fucker, I was literally just
calling the cops when you walked
in. What happened?


                         I want out of this marriage.



                              (genuinely shocked)
What?


                              (looks at him)
I want out of this marriage.


                         Why?


                         We'll call it uncontested or
whatever. I just want out.

               John moves to sit beside her on the couch. Ann does not look
at him.


                              (conciliatory)
Ann, honey, please, tell me what's
wrong. Don't just say you want
out and leave me wondering. You
can't just go without telling me
why.

               Ann turns to look at him for a moment, then turns away.


                         Fuck you. I can do what I want.

               John's mouth literally hangs open in shock. He is dumbstruck.


                         I'll stay at my mother's.

               John gets up from the couch and begins pacing.


                         Where did you go when you left
here?


                         I drove around. Then I went to
talk with Graham.

               John smacks his hand on his leg.


                         Goddammit, goddammit!! That son
of a bitch!!
(thinking)
Well, at least I know you didn't
fuck him.


                         No, but I wanted to. I really
wanted to, partially just to piss
you off.

               John is seething.


                         You're leaving me for him, aren't
you? Well, that makes a sad sort
of sense. He can't, and you won't.


                         I'm not going to discuss this with
you anymore. You're making no
sense.

               John walks over to Ann.


                         Did you make one of those goddam
tapes?

               Ann says nothing.


                         Answer me, godammit!! Did you make
one of those tapes?


                         Yes!

               John explodes, hitting the wall all around Ann. She cowers
beneath the storm.

               John bolts from the house.






               Graham stands in the middle of the room with a cigarette in
his mouth, trying to teach himself to moonwalk.



               John screeches to a halt, parking haphazardly. He gets out of
the car and runs to Graham's apartment.



               John bursts through the door without bothering to knock. Graham
looks up, startled. Before he can even react, John has him by
the lapels.


                         Hi, John.


                         Where are the tapes, Graham?


                         What tapes?


                         You know which tapes! Where are
they?


                         John, as a lawyer, you should know
that those tapes are private
property.


                         So is my wife, asshole!!


                         She's not property, John, she's a
person. Were you just going to
keep right on lying to her?


                         What the hell do you think? I
love Ann. You think I'm going to
tell her about Cynthia and hurt
her feelings like that?


                         God, you need help.


                         I need help? Whose sitting by
himself in a room choking his
chauncey to a bunch of videotapes,
Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the
fucking nut. Now show me those
tapes.


                         No.


                         I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd
better do what I say. Give me those
tapes.


                         No.

               John punches Graham in the jaw, knocking him to the floor.
Graham feels his mouth for blood as John picks him up by the
shirt.


                         Graham, I swear to Christ I'll
kill your scrawny ass. Now give
me those tapes.


                         No.

               John roughly pushes Graham into one of the director's chairs,
which topples over and throws Graham to the floor once again.

               John looks around. He sees the boxes of tapes and begins to
go through the contents. Graham gets up and runs over to stop
him.


                         Get away from those!! They belong
to me!!

               Graham and John struggle. John hits Graham in the stomach and
pushes him to the floor.


                         Give me your keys.


                         My keys?

               John bends over and starts going through Graham's pockets.


                         Your keys, asshole!! Your two
fucking keys!! Give them to me!!


                         I'm not going to give you my keys.

               John beats Graham until Graham can offer no resistance. He then
drags Graham into the hallway and leaves him there.

               John then locks himself inside Graham's apartment.

               John walks over to the boxes of videotapes and begins to search
through them spastically. He finds both Cynthia and Ann's tapes.
After a brief deliberation, he decides to watch Ann's. He turns
on the player and the monitor. After pulling a chair up to the
screen, John presses the button marked "play".

               In the hallway, Graham drags himself to the door of his
apartment. Putting his ear to the inlet, he strains to hear
what is going on inside.

               John watches the monitor come to life.

               The image is Ann, sitting in a chair.


                              (on tape)
Tell me your name.


                              (on tape)
Ann Bishop Millaney.


                              (on tape)
You are married, correct?


                         Goddam right.


                              (on tape)
Yes.


                              (on tape)
Who usually initiates sex?

               John's jaw tightens.


                         Bastard...


                              (on tape)
He does.


                              (on tape)
Do you talk to him?


                              (on tape)
When we're making love?


                              (on tape)
Yes.


                              (on tape)
Sometimes. Afterward.


                              (on tape)
Does he go down on you?


                              (shouting at Graham)
You son of a bitch!!


                              (on tape)
Not very often.


                              (on tape)
I would.

               John is literally so mad he can't speak. He watches the screen
in mute anger, his hands wrapped tightly around the arms of
the chair. Graham still listens from the hallway.


                              (on tape)
Have you ever wanted to make love
to someone other than your husband?


                         Goddamit...

               Ann hesitates.


                              (to Ann's image)
Answer him, goddammit!!


                              (on tape)
You're hesitating. I think that
means you have.


                              (to Graham on tape)
Shut up!!!


                              (on tape)
You don't know what I'm thinking.


                              (on tape)
It's a simple question. Have you
ever thought of having--making
love with someone other than your
husband?

               John leans forward.


                              (on tape)
Is he going to see this?


                              (on tape)
Absolutely not.

               A sarcastic chuckle from John. In the hallway, Graham furrows
his brow.


                              (on tape)
I have thought about it, yes.


                              (to Ann's image)
You bitch. I knew it.


                              (on tape)
Did you have sex before you were
married?


                              (on tape)
Yes.


                              (on tape)
Did the person you made love with
satisfy you more than your husband?


                              (to Graham)
God damn you!!


                              (on tape)
Yes.

               John stands and throws his chair against the door. Graham, still
listening at the door, is startled.


                              (on tape)
And you have thought about...making
love to that person again since
you ve been married?

               John watches the monitor, his eyes beginning to water.


                              (on tape)
I don't see what difference it
makes, I mean, I can think what
I want.
(pause)
I don't know if I want to do this
anymore, I'm afraid...I don't mind
answering the questions so much,
but if somebody were to see this...


                              (on tape)
At some level, I don't understand
your nervousness. Have you decided
to leave John?

               Ann thinks. John watches.


                              (on tape)
Yes, I have. I will.


                              (on tape)
Then as far as this taping goes,
you have nothing to worry about.


                              (on tape)
I guess not.


                              (on tape)
Do you want me to stop?

               John, absorbed in the image, absently shakes his head.


                              (on tape)
No.


                              (on tape)
Are there people other than your
previous lover that you have
fantasized about?

               A pause.


                              (on tape)
Yes. Whenever...all right, look.
Whenever I see a man that I think
is attractive, I wonder what it
would be like with him, I mean,
I'm just curious, I don't act on
it, but I hate that I think that!!
I wish I could just forget about
that stuff!!


                              (on tape)
Why?


                              (on tape)
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!!
All she does is think about that
stuff, and I hate that, I don't
want to be like her, I don't want
to be like her!!


                              (on tape)
You're not like your sister. You
couldn't be like her if you wanted
to.


                              (on tape)
I know. Deep down, I know that.
It just bothers me, when I have
feelings or impulses that she has.

               John picks up the chair he threw and sets it upright. He sits
down and watches the screen impassively. Graham still listens
from outside.


                              (on tape)
So you do fantasize?


                              (on tape)
Yes.


                              (on tape)
About who?


                              (on tape)
I fantasized about you.


                              (on tape)
About me?


                              (on tape)
Yes.

               A pause.


                              (on tape)
Have you fantasized about me?


                              (on tape)
I thought I made that clear before,
when I said I would go down on
you.


                              (on tape)
I remember. You could do that,
couldn't you? Go down on me?


                              (on tape)
Yes.


                              (on tape)
If I asked you to, would you? Not
on tape, I mean?


                              (on tape)
No.


                              (on tape)
On tape?


                              (on tape)
No.


                              (on tape)
Why not?


                              (on tape)
If I can't do it all, I don't want
to do anything. And I can't do
it all.


                              (on tape)
Can't or won't?

               A pause. John is still watching the tape, his face betraying
no emotion. Graham still listens from outside.



               The previous afternoon. We are no longer looking at Ann on the
monitor, but watching her and Graham AS THEY MADE THE TAPE. For
instance, we can now see Graham from Ann's point of view, or the
two of them at the same time, etc.


                         Can't.


                         You said you weren't always
impotent.


                         That's correct.


                         So you have had sex.


                         Yes.


                         Who was the last person you had
sex with?


                         Her name was Elizabeth.


                         So what happened? Was it so bad
that it turned you off?


                         No, it was wonderful. That wasn't
the problem.


                         What was the problem?


                         The problem was me. I was...I was
a pathological liar. Or am, I
should say. Lying is like
alcoholism, one is always
"recovering".


                         So you lied to her?


                         Yes. I did. Willfully and
repeatedly.


                         How come?


                         I loved her for how good she made
me feel, and I hated her for how
good she made me feel. And at that
time, I tended to express my
feelings non-verbally. I couldn't
handle anyone having that much
control over my emotions.


                         And now you can?


                         Now I make sure that no one has
the opportunity to test me.


                         Don't you get lonely?


                         How could I, with all these nice
people stopping by? The fact is
that I've lived by myself for so
long, I can't imagine living with
another person. It's amazing what
you can get used to if enough time
goes by. And anyway, I'm asking
the questions. Are you happy?


                         I don't know anymore. I thought 
I was, but obviously I was wrong.


                         Did you confront John with the
fact that you knew about him?


                         Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I
just want out.


                         If you do get out of your marriage,
will you continue to be inhibited?


                         I don't know. It all gets back
to that Cynthia thing. I don't
like her...eagerness. There's
nothing left to imagine, there's
no...


                         Subtlety?


                         Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus,
I've never really felt able to
open up with anyone. I mean, that
other person I told you about,
I enjoyed making love with him
a lot, but I still wasn't able
to really let go. I always feel
like I'm being watched and I
shouldn't embarrass myself.


                         And you feel the same way with
John?


                         Kind of. I mean, John's like this
kind of...craftsman. Like he's
a carpenter, and he makes really
good tables. But that's all he
can make, and I don't need anymore
tables.


                         Interesting analogy.


                         I'm babbling.


                         No, you're not.


                              (thinking)
God, I m so mad at him!!


                         You should be. He lied to you.
So did Cynthia.


                         Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect
that from her, I mean, she'll do
it with almost anybody, I don't
know, I shouldn't stick up for
her I guess, but him. He lied
so...deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch
him die!!

               Ann sits quietly for a moment. Graham watches her silently.
The camera continues to roll.


                              (looks up at Graham)
You're really never going to make
love again?


                         I'm not planning on it.

               A pause.


                         If you were in love with me, would
you?


                         I'm not in love with you.


                         But if you were?


                         I...I can't answer that precisely.


                         But I feel like maybe I could be
really comfortable with you.


                         That's very flattering.


                         So why won't you make love with
me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?


                         Ann. Are you asking me
hypothetically, or are you asking
me for real, right now?


                         I'm asking for real. I want you
to turn that camera off and make
love with me. Will you?

               A pause.


                         I can't.


                         Why not?


                         I've told you.


                         But I don't understand--


                         Ann, it could happen to me all
over again, don't you see? I could
start to--


                         But how do you know for sure, you
have to try to find a way to fig--


                         I couldn't face her if I had slept
with somebody else.

               A pause.


                         Who? Elizabeth?


                              (uncomfortable)
Yes.


                         You mean you're still in contact
with her?


                         No.


                         But you're planning to be?


                         I don't know. Possibly.


                         Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What's going on here? Did you come
back here just to see her again?


                         Not entirely.


                         But that was part of it?


                         Yes.


                         Like maybe a big part?


                         Possibly.


                         Graham, I mean, what do you think
her reaction is going to be if
you contact her?


                         I don't know.


                         Look at you, look at what's
happened to you, look how you've
changed! Don't you think she will
have changed?


                         I don't know. I really would rather
not talk about it.


                              (has to laugh)
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that
on tape!! You won't answer a
question about Elizabeth, but I
have to answer all these intimate
questions about my sex life!!
Graham, what do you think she's
going to make of all these
videotapes? Are you going to tell
her about them? I can't imagine
her being too understanding about
that. But since you don't lie
anymore, you'll have to say
something.


                         As I said, I haven't decided what
to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't
do anything.


                         Oh, you just moved here to think
about it, right?

               Graham says nothing. Ann looks at him.


                         Oh, God, Graham, this is
so...pathetic. You're not even
what you pretend to be, you're
a lie, you're a bigger lie than
you ever were.

               Graham sets the camera down, though it continues to record.
He is visibly upset.


                         All right, you want to talk about
lies, let's talk about lies, Ann.
Let's talk about lying to yourself.
You haven't been able to sleep
with your husband because you're
no longer in love with him, and
maybe you never were. You haven't
been honest with yourself in longer
than you can remember.


                              (heated)
Yeah, you're right. But I never
claimed to know everything like 
you, and have all these little
theories. I'm still learning, I
know that. But I don't feel like
I've wasted time. If I had to go
through my marriage to get to where
I am right now, fine.

               Ann moves in closer, burrowing, her eyes on fire.


                         But you. You have wasted nine
years. I mean, that has to be
some sort of weird record or
something, nine years. How does
that feel?

               Graham says nothing. Ann picks up the camera and points it at
him.


                         Don't do that.


                         Why not?


                         Because.


                         "Because"? That's not good enough.
I asked you a question, Graham.
I asked you "how does it feel"?
How does it feel, Mr. I Want To
Go Down On You But I Can't? Do
you know how many people you've
sucked into your weird little
world? Including me? Come on,
how does it feel?


                         I can't tell you like this.


                         I'm just going to keep asking until
you answer. I'm sure there's plenty
of tape.


                         I don't find this "turning the
tables" thing very interesting--


                         I don't care.

               Graham reaches up for the camera. Ann knocks his hand away.


                         Not until I get some answers. Tell
what you feel. Not what you think,
I've heard plenty of that. What
you feel.

               Graham is on the verge of completely falling apart.


                         Come on!!


                         All right!! All right!! You want
to know? You want to know how
I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that
what you wanted to hear?

               A pause. Graham regains his composure somewhat.


                         Why are you ashamed?


                         Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody
anything? I think you have this
idea that people are either all
good or all bad, and you don't
allow for any gray areas, and
that's what most of us consist
of.


                         You're not answering me.


                              (heated)
Well, what kind of answer are you
looking for, Ann? What is it
exactly that you want to know?


                         I want to know why you are the
way you are!


                         And I'm telling you it's not any
one thing that I can point to and
say "That's why!" It doesn't work
that way with people who have
problems, Ann, it's not that neat,
it's not that tidy! It's not a
series of little boxes that you
can line up and count. Things
just don't happen that way.


                         But why can't you just put it all
behind you? Can't you just forget
it? All that stuff you did?


                         No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget
it. It's not something I can fix.
It's difficult. There s something
in my mind...the way my brain
works...
[frustrated)
God, Ann, when you're with another
person, and you re...inside
them, you're so vulnerable, you're
revealing so much...there's no
protection. And...somebody could
say, or do something to you while
you re in this...state
of...nakedness. And they could
hurt you without even knowing it.
In a way that you couldn't even
see.
(looks at Ann)
And you would withdraw. To make
sure it didn't happen again.

               Ann looks at him for a long moment and then sets the camera
down.

               She moves in front of Graham and kneels.


                         I want to touch you.

               Graham shakes his head.


                         I want to touch you.


                         No.

               Ann reaches out, and Graham instinctively begins to move away.


                         Graham.

               Something in her voice makes him stop. Their eyes lock. Graham
slowly moves back toward her.

               Ann's hand eases out to him, her eyes still burning into his.
Graham closes his eyes, accepting Ann's touch.

               She caresses him.

               Slowly.

               Delicately.

               She touches his arms, his face, his hair.

               Closing her eyes, she takes his hand and puts it against her
face.

               She begins to lie him back on the couch. When he offers light
resistance, she gently persists.


                         Keep your eyes closed.

               Graham lies back, silently obeying.

               Ann touches his face.

               Gradually, her hand slips to his neck and she begins to 
unbutton his shirt. She watches his face, hoping that he will
remain calm. He does.

               She rubs her hand on his chest.

               Once again she brings Graham's hand to her face. She moves his
hand to her neck and throat, painting her skin with his fingers.

               Soon each hand is exploring the other. Fingers search for and
find hidden areas.

               Ann stands.

               Their hands remain together, and Graham's eyes remain closed.
Ann moves onto the couch with Graham.

               She gently lowers herself into a sitting position on his waist.

               She slowly moves both of her hands onto Graham's chest. They
move forward and back, like a lazy tide.

               She looks at Graham. His face is tranquil.

               Ann quietly begins to move her face toward his.

               Soon she is hovering inches above him, her long hair touching
his features.

               She lowers her lips to his forehead and kisses him. She waits
for a negative reaction. Getting none, she moves lower and 
kisses his eyes. Still receiving no discouragement, she moves
to his nose.

               A subtle movement from Graham. Ann waits for a moment.

               She then moves to his lips, her luxuriant tresses enveloping
his face.

               She kisses him lightly.

               She kisses him again.

               Graham tilts his head back and she softly kisses his neck.

               Graham's hands make their way up Ann's back until they have
reached her neck. He slowly pulls his face to hers.

               He kisses her.

               Graham is flooded with warmth and excitement.

               He caresses her, intoxicating himself with physical contact.

               The kisses become more meaningful, and the touching becomes
more passionate.

               For a moment, Graham seems about to evaporate in a state of
ecstasy, his eyes filled with relief and happiness.

               But his gaze happens to fall on the video camera, which
continues to record.

               Graham seizes up and abruptly backs away from Ann's embrace.
Reality slowly envelopes him.


                         Graham...


                         I'm okay. It's okay.

               Ann reaches for his hand. He allows her to take it.


                              (almost dazed)
It's okay.

               Graham looks at Ann for a long moment. She sees the acceptance
and gratitude in his eyes. She smiles lightly.

               Graham moves forward and shuts off the camera.



               John watching the tape. There is video snow on the monitor now.
The tape timer reads 46:02. John gets up slowly, ejects the tape
from the player, and heads for the door.

               Graham, hearing the footsteps approach, backs away from the
inlet. His eye is swollen, and he holds one of his hands in
a curious position.

               John opens the door. He looks at Graham for a moment before
reaching into his pocket for Graham's keys. He dangles them
in his hand as he stands over Graham.


                         I never told you this, because
I thought it would crush you, but
now I could give a shit.
(pause)
I fucked Elizabeth. Before you
broke up. Before you were having
trouble, even. So you can stop
making her into a saint. She was
good in bed and she could keep
a secret. And that's about all
I can say about her.

               John drops Graham's keys to the floor and leaves. Graham stands,
fighting back tears, and walks into his apartment.

               He pulls Ann's tape from the videotape player.

               He reaches inside the cassette cartridge and pulls the videotape
itself out, ruining it forever. He does the same to every other
tape in both the boxes. Calmly. Deliberately. Methodically.

               He walks over to the camera/recorder, trailing a mound of
videotape behind him. He breaks the lens off the camera body,
and smashes the inner workings against the edge of the table.
He then drops the damaged unit into the pile of destroyed tape,
where it disappears.







               John Millaney talks to his colleague.


                         Man, not having to answer to
anybody... I feel like this huge
weight has been lifted from my
shoulders. I mean, come on, if
I decide that I'd rather live
alone, what's so bad about that?
It's not like I've decided to live
a life of crime, right?
It's just how I feel, you can't
help the way you feel, you just
have to be honest about it.

               John dials a number on his telephone.





                              (to phone)
Brian Kirkland, please.


                         May I ask who's calling?


                         John Millaney.


                         One moment.


                              (to his colleague)
Anyway, I've always said, the work
is the thing. I can be happy
without a marriage, but take away
my work, that's different. And
if Ann can't handle that, that's
her problem, like we re all alone
in this world, you know what I'm
saying? I mean, fuck.
(looks at phone)
Jesus, what's takin' this guy?

               The intercom clicks to life.


                              (on speaker)
Mr. Millaney?


                         Yeah.


                              (on speaker)
Mr. Forman would like to see you
in his office.


                         Okay, in a minute, I'm on with
a client.


                         (on speaker)
He said immediately.


                         All right, jesus.

               The intercom clicks off.


                         Mr. Millaney?


                         Yes?


                         Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform
you that he has obtained legal
representation elsewhere, and that
if you have a message for him to
leave it with me.

               John swallows.


                         Thank you. I...there is no message.
Thank you.

               John hangs up. He thinks for a moment, rubbing his forehead.

               The intercom clicks to life.


                              (on speaker)
Mr. Millaney, Mr. Forman is
waiting.


                              (voice over)
Come on, I'm not asking too much,
am I? Just one little question.



               Cynthia is tending bar. The Dude from earlier is still there,
puffing On a big cigar.


                         Just tell me what time you get
off. Work, I mean. What's the
harm in that? Whaddaya say?

               Ann enters the lounge. Cynthia watches with apprehensive
surprise as Ann approaches with a potted plant.


                              (to Dude)
Excuse me.

               Cynthia moves to meet Ann at the end of the bar. Ann sets the
plant down on the counter. Her manner is diffident, but not
hostile.


                         I know it's your birthday, and
I know you like plants. So I got
you this.

               Cynthia is very moved, though she struggles valiantly to conceal
her emotions.


                         Thank you.


                         Well. I can't stay.

               Ann begins to leave.


                         Can I call you?

               Ann turns back to face her. They look at each other for a
moment.


                         Do you have my work number?


                         No.

               Ann writes the number down on a napkin.


                         I get real busy between two and
four.


                         Okay.

                         Ann looks at Cynthia again before leaving.


                         Bye.


                         Bye.

               Ann leaves. Cynthia continues to look at the door long after
Ann has left.


                         Nice plant.

          Cynthia turns to him.


                         Do me a favor. Don't come in here
anymore.





               Graham sits reading. There is now some furniture in the
apartment. Bookshelves, plants, etc. There are periodicals on
the table where the video gear used to be. There are no
cigarettes.

               There is a knock at Graham's door, which now has a deadbolt
lock.


                         Who is it?

               A knock again. Graham sets his book down and goes to the door.
He unlocks the deadbolt and opens it.

               Ann stands in the hallway.

               Graham is obviously flushed with feeling at seeing her. She
wordlessly moves into the room, her movements like a slow
breeze, her expression calm.

               Graham watches her go by.

               She stops in the middle of the room, her back to him.

               Graham moves toward her slowly. Sensing him behind her, her
breathing becomes deep.

               Graham slowly enfolds her in his arms, his face against her
hair.

               She closes her eyes as their fingers entwine.
