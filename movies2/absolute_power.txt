1   INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY                                   1

The saddest eyes you ever saw.

We are looking at an El Greco drawing.       It is a study for
one of his paintings.

    PULL BACK TO REVEAL --

A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes,
the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so
brilliantly.

Most of the students are around 20.        A couple of suburban
housewives are there too.

And one older man.

This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly
dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a
successful company executive.

As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great
concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss
nothing: He has pilot's eyes.

We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this
is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the
hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --

Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the
eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.

Luther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at his
work a moment, shakes his head.

                                GIRL STUDENT
               Don't give up.

                                LUTHER
               I never do.

                                GIRL STUDENT
               May I?

She's indicated his sketchbook.      He nods.   She starts
thumbing through.

The sketchbook as the pages turn.

Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.         The
hands are better. Very skillful.

                                                     (CONTINUED)



1     CONTINUED:                                                    1

The GIRL hands it back.    Impressed.

                                 GIRL STUDENT
                   You work with your hands, don't
you?


      CLOSEUP - LUTHER                                                  *

An enigmatic smile.    Now, from that --


2     EXT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                          2

A nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here
but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the
houses neat and well tended.

Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's
afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.


3     INT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                       3

Luther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working
class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man
Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They
are good enough friends not to ask each other questions.

                               LUTHER
                       (as they nod to
each other)
Redhead.

                                RED
                Luther.
(as Luther hands
him a videotape)
Your life would be a whole lot
simpler if you could learn to
operate a V.C.R.

                              LUTHER
                My only failing.

As he turns --


4     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                   4

A street of   small row houses. Clean, well tended.
Luther walks   toward one. Later in the afternoon. He
carries half   a dozen small shopping bags, from the
market, the   hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners.



5   EXT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                                    5

A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door.
Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly,
bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front
door.


6   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                          6

as he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer,
lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food
away --


7   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT                    7

Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle.
Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther
himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it
down.

A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley
sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on
another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan
cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass.
Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner.

Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a
photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little
girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands
alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at
them happily. It's Luther. When he was young.

Luther studies the photo a moment.    Then he turns, looks
out the window.


8   POV SHOT - SLIVER OF MOON                                    8

is visible.     Lovely.   Peaceful.


9   LUTHER                                                       9

Now Luther opens the sketch pad, quickly flips past the
hands and eyes and faces --

-- we are looking at something totally different:   a
mansion.

HOLD ON Luther's drawing of the mansion.

    KEEP HOLDING.

PULL BACK to reveal --



10   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                  10

In the moonlight -- it looks exactly like his drawing.

But no drawing could convey the size of the place -- we
are looking at ten thousand square feet. Wealth and
power.

We're in rolling hill country.     The mansion is dark.
Totally deserted. Silence.

Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO
VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The
lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides
to a stop. Again, silence...

HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away.     There
is a small field between the car and the estate.     Now --


11   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                11

A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears
dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars,
begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --

-- it's Luther, and he's been a  professional thief his
entire life. He's a three-time   loser, but his last
sentence was so long ago and his  skills are now so vast,
so refined, that it is unlikely  he will ever get caught
again.


12   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                        12

The grounds as Luther glides through it.     He wears a
backpack.

The night is cool.

He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is
a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't
gorgeous -- it's no-man's land.

One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off,
in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground.
He makes no sound at all.


13   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                     13

Thick wood with reinforced steel.

Luther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens
it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer
of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a
key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the
instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:



14   INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT                        14

The infrared SECURITY DETECTOR -- it immediately starts
to BEEP and you can see the seconds being counted down:
forty, thirty-nine, thirty --

                                                CUT TO:


15   LUTHER                                                       15

-- in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver, no more
than six inches long --

-- he sets to work on the security panel that is inside
in the foyer next to the front door.

The screwdriver undoes the first screw, the second --

                                                CUT TO:


16   SECURITY DETECTOR                                            16

Thirty-one, thirty, twenty --

                                                CUT TO:


17   SCREWDRIVER                                                  17

Now the third and fourth screws are in hands and he lifts
the security panel away.

The BEEPING sound is constant --

-- and getting louder.

A tiny device, no bigger than a pocket calculator. It
has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to
find out, a tiny computer. Luther holds it like a baby.

                                                CUT TO:


18   SECURITY DETECTOR                                            18

Eighteen, seventeen --

                                                CUT TO:


19   LUTHER                                                       19

probing with the wires into the heart of the security
panel.

                                                (CONTINUED)



19   CONTINUED:                                                 19

The BEEPING is LOUDER still.

The security panel. Luther is attempting delicate work
and it's dark so it isn't easy but he continues to probe
with the wires and --

                                                CUT TO:


20   SECURITY DETECTOR                                          20

Eleven, ten --

                                                CUT TO:


21   LUTHER                                                     21

and he's got it attached!


22   COMPUTER                                                   22

Now the face of the tiny computer is alive with numbers
-- they fly by much too fast for us to make them out
clearly.

                                                CUT TO:


23   SECURITY DETECTOR                                          23

Four, three, two --

                                                CUT TO:


24   FACE OF TINY COMPUTER                                      24

as five numbers lock -- 7 -- 13 -- 19 -- 8 -- 11 --

The BEEPING sound dies.

                                                CUT TO:


25   LUTHER                                                     25

A glance across the foyer -- the lights of the security
detector go from red to a warm looking green.

Safe.

                                                (CONTINUED)



25    CONTINUED:                                                   25

He allows himself to exhale. Then he's busy again,
unhooking the computer. His fingers, as always, work
quickly, precisely.


25A   INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT                        25A

The foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack,
moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again
shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place.

It's as if he hadn't been there at all...


26    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT                    26

Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the
vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it
looked in the moonlight.

A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past
it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a
late one, when the madness had him and things were
sliding away. Very sad.

Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment --

-- then surprisingly he raises his hand,  and for just an
instant traces the lines of the painting  in the air, as
if trying to figure out how the magic was  done, as if
getting ready for his next museum session  --

-- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the
third floor.


27    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - THIRD-FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT          27

Here's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an
overpowering sense of being alone --

-- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers "wow,"
moves on.


28    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      28

Luther, walking down the third-floor corridor.

The corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see
a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby
girl, the next one of the same child at three.

We watch the child grow up in these photos.    At ten she
is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner.
                                                    (CONTINUED)



28    CONTINUED:                                                  28

Not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into,
if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret. The kind of girl
you ached for in high school. The perfect cheerleader.

These are pictures, we will come to know, of Christy
Sullivan. A high school graduation shot at eighteen, a
shot in front of a Burger King at twenty.


      CLOSEUP - WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH                                     *

Christy, looking just fabulous, is 24 and smiling
happily. We can only see her face and the wedding veil
here. Now --

PULL BACK to reveal --

A glorious and expensive white wedding dress.    Christy
holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking.

      KEEP PULLING BACK.

And now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter
is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride.

Walter, it might be noted, is eighty years old.

Luther, staring at the photo, shakes his head.    Now he
moves on.


29    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT              29

Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside,
closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down,
takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up.
Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied
bed.

A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver
clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop
the other, several more photos of the happy couple --

-- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a
thick leather handle.

Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large
full-length mirror across from the canopied bed.

Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself,
he's studying the mirror itself.

He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs
and a sofa and a large TV and VCR.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



29   CONTINUED:                                                   29

Three remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up
the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at
the large mirror, clicks once --

-- and the mirror swings silently open.

A room is revealed. All we can see of it so far is this:
There is an armchair in the middle facing where the
mirror had been.

Luther turns back toward the sitting area, the remote
held in his hand.

The side table. Luther puts the remote down -- very
carefully. In the exact position it had been. Now he
takes a moment, blows on his hands, rubs them together.

Then -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his
backpack, moves with the work light into the revealed
room --


30   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - VAULT - NIGHT                 30

It's a vault! And it's FULL! There's cash, naturally,
piles of the stuff. Plus all kinds of other valuables
we'll get around to.

Luther's a little stunned -- it's more than he hoped for.

He glances at the armchair -- there is a remote on it
that is identical to the one he replaced at the side
table.

Now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work.
First the cash goes in -- all neatly bundled. Large
denominations. Lots of bundles. Next are a series of
slender boxes --

The first box as Luther opens it.

Jewelry.

Into the duffel it goes.

Luther, emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel.    And
still more. As he continues to do this --


31   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         31

All is quiet. High on a wall, the security light beams a
friendly green.

Now, from somewhere, a distant sound.   LAUGHTER?   Was it
laughter? Doesn't matter, it's gone.



32    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                     32

Luther has moved deeper into it -- he's finished with the
jewelry. Now he's examining piles of bonds.

Into the duffel they go.

He takes a breath, glances around.    Perfect.

Coins.   Antique ones.   They disappear into the duffel.

Stamp books.   Gone into the swelling duffel.

Luther as he hears now the DISTANT LAUGHTER.     Not so
perfect.


33    INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     33   *

He moves quickly out of the vault, takes a step toward
the door -- the GIGGLING is getting LOUDER, closer. Two
people. A man and a woman.

Luther stops, mutters "shit!" -- glances around -- No
place to hide. Luther, grabbing his backpack, moves into
the vault, turns off his work light, and shuts the door
with the remote. The DOOR CLICKS --


34    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                     34

-- Luther is alone in the darkness.

A burst of LAUGHTER now.    Growing nearer still.

Luther moves into the back of the vault, crouches down,
doing his best to hide behind the armchair. Trapped,
Luther waits in silence, trying not to breathe...

Now he can hear a SQUEAK -- the BEDROOM DOOR has opened.

      HOLD.


35    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                            35

Dark -- except for a slant of light from the hall outside
the open bedroom door.

Two people are briefly visible as they enter, a MAN and a
WOMAN. The CLINK of GLASS. Stifled LAUGHTER.

The Woman closes the bedroom door.

Darkness again.

And now the LAUGHING sound increases.    GIGGLING, really.



36   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  36

Luther in the pitch-black vault. The GIGGLING is MUTED
but it is there. He is starting to perspire.


37   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         37

The woman flicks on the lights and as she does --


38   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  38

Luther as the burst of light hits him like a fist -- and
it's over.

Luther blinks, confused, looks around --

-- because it isn't over, he hasn't been caught.

The door to the vault is suddenly gone. Luther is
staring straight into the goddamn bedroom.

Because the door is a two way mirror. Now it's as if he
was watching the bedroom on a giant TV screen.

Just a few feet away, just outside the door.

Where things are clearly starting to heat up.

Luther moves to the armchair, sits.    There is nothing to
do now but wait. He settles in.


39   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         39

They are staring at each other.

We have seen the woman already -- she's CHRISTY SULLIVAN.
But the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice.

This is a fabulous-looking twenty-five-year-old woman.
Long, golden hair, a round face that sets off her deep
blue eyes, a tanned, curving body. A bare-shouldered
black dress. An expensive necklace.

One more thing:   she is staggering drunk.

The man is ALAN RICHMOND, wealthy, successful, handsome
and fit. Mid-forties. He wears an elegantly-cut suit.

Two additional points: (1) Richmond is clearly not the
husband in the wedding photo. (2) He is drunker than she
is.

                                                  (CONTINUED)



39   CONTINUED:                                                       39

Richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers.     He
fills them, gives one to her.

They touch glasses.    Down the hatch.   Tight laughter.

He looks at her.

She looks at him.    There's a lot of sexual tension in the
air.

But now he begins looking around, checking things out.
She spots this.

                                 CHRISTY
                         (drunk)
It's okay -- I told him I was
sick -- anyway, he's gone --
relax...

He nods then, more at ease.    And he blows her a kiss.

She catches it -- and now she starts to parade for him.
Her body moving very slowly.

He pours himself another shot, chugs it, watches.     Now --


40   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                      40

Luther suddenly terrified and we find out why.


41   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                             41

Christy, fumbling with her necklace, looks across the
room --

What she's looking at:     the side table with the remote
that opens the vault.


42   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                      42

Luther, frozen, as Christy starts toward the table.


43   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                             43

The table and the remote waiting there.


44   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                      44

Luther, mouth dry...



45    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         45

Richmond, reaching out for her, then as she passes him;
he takes her by the hand --

-- and now they are dancing, their bodies pressed
together. They move slowly. She hums. He tries to get
fancy, spin her with one arm --

-- no good. They're too drunk for it, starts to lose
balance, separate.

They giggle. Smile at each other. Now Christy manages
to unhook her necklace, and as she starts to drop it in           *
the drawer of the nightstand --                                   *


46    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  46

Luther.   A genuine sigh of relief --

-- which suddenly dies --


47    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         47

Christy, as she spins toward the table again, still with
the necklace in her hand.


48    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  48

Luther, and there's nothing he can do now but watch.


49    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         49

Richmond, watching too, emptying the vodka bottle into
his tumbler, chugging it down and now...

The table as Christy reaches out, grabs a remote, turns.


50    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  50

Luther dead in the water because --


51    CHRISTY'S                                                    51

pointing the goddam thing at him --

-- and as she CLICKS it --



52    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                52

Luther, and for a moment, he's like a goddam deer caught
in the headlights --

-- but now here comes another sigh of relief and we find
out why.


53    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                       53

Suddenly there's ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING -- she's turned
the STEREO ON. Christy starts humming, replaces the
clicker, drops the necklace in the drawer.                      *

Then they are into each other's arms. Their bodies
press. Their bodies sway. He moves a hand to her
breasts --

-- Christy breaks loose, shakes a finger at him, as if to
say, "naughty, naughty" --

-- then with one hand, she pulls a zipper down. The
dress falls off her body. Her breasts spring free. She
is wearing only her panties now and high heels. And a
smile.

She is stunning looking and she knows it and men have
always gone nuts over her and she knows that too. And
Richmond can't resist her either, goes to her, bends her
back, caresses her neck, begins sucking her nipples.
Christy moans.


54    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                54

Luther, in the chair, embarrassed, averting his eyes.

But the MOANING from the other room GROWS LOUDER, more
insistent.


55    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                       55

Christy, pulling away for a moment, starting to work at
Richmond's tie, shakes him out of his suit jacket,
reaches for his belt, loosens it. She is working at his
shirt buttons now and their breathing is audible and in a
moment he is down to his boxer shorts and then her
panties are off, her shoes kicked away and they are near
the vault mirror now. As they approach it, they stare at
themselves.


56    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                56

Luther, moving farther back in his chair as their faces
are just a couple of feet away --



57    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - CHRISTY - NIGHT 57

as Richmond's hands move across her wondrous body and she
is hot and drifting into drunken fantasy and her eyes
close and --


      CLOSE ON RICHMOND                                                *

as his eyes are open --

-- the look on his drunken face is scary.


58    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 58

Luther, transfixed by that look, transfixed and worried.


59    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - CHRISTY AND RICHMOND         59


looking at each other now, and she is smiling happily and
looking at him and he is smiling happily and looking at
her, and whatever was on his face just before has gone.


60    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 60

Luther, watching as they turn for the gigantic canopied
bed.


61    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                        61

The bed as they stop alongside it and kiss -- it's their
first. And her arms go around his neck and she holds him
like that, her eyes shut tight --


62    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 62

Luther -- watching because Richmond's eyes are not shut,
they are wide open and they stare at the mirror and the
awful look from before is back, only worse, and then
without warning, he grips her buttocks roughly --

-- and slaps her hard on the ass, over and over and
Christy is shocked, surprised, pulls away. Richmond
smiles at her sweetly.

Christy.   Shaking her head.

Richmond. He continues to smile, makes a courtly
gesture, kissing her fingertips in apology.

                                                  (CONTINUED)



62   CONTINUED:                                                     62

Christy. She smiles in acknowledgement and they move
onto the bed. She pushes him down and straddles him.

Richmond, from her POINT OF VIEW -- a wonderfully-
handsome man.

Christy, from his POINT OF VIEW. A glorious, vibrant
young woman. She smiles, touches her lips to a finger,
reaches out, touches the finger to his mouth.

It's a sweet moment.

They smile.

Then he reaches up, and without a word, grabs her breasts
and squeezes and twists them brutally and Christy is
shocked and she tries to make him stop but he won't, and
she cries out in pain but he still won't stop so she
slaps him in the face. He slaps her back, viciously,
right in the mouth and now there is blood mixing with her
lipstick and she rolls off the bed onto the floor.

Christy sits there stunned.

                             CHRISTY
                      (slurred)
You fucking bastard.

And on that --

Richmond, standing now, reaches down to help her up.
Christy hesitates, finally takes his hand and as soon as
she is on her feet --

Christy, kicking him with all she has, in the stomach.


63   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                    63

Luther, silently applauding.


64   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                           64

Richmond, the air momentarily out of him,  falling
drunkenly to the floor, stunned for just  a moment and
clearly in pain, but he is a big man and  he is strong and
he grabs her ankle, yanks, and then both  are laboring on
the floor and Christy kicks him again and  again --

-- but he will not release her ankle.   Each kick only
inflames his drunken rage.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



64   CONTINUED:                                                      64

                                RICHMOND
                         (very slurred --)
You little whore --

And now they both try and stand.

Neither one does it gracefully, neither one does it
quickly, but Richmond gets there first and as soon as he
is on his feet he begins to strangle her.

Christy, gasping, terrified, she claws at his arms, her
fingers scratching deeply --

-- but he will not let go.

She twists and jerks her body --

-- no good -- he continues to tighten his grip on her
throat --

-- and spreads his legs for better balance.

The bed table, as Christy, beyond desperation reaches
around for something, anything -- her fingers finally
close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke, she
slashes his right arm.

Now he lets go.    And stares, stunned, at his bleeding
arm.

Then he crunches her flush in the   mouth, a brutal blow,
and blood pours from her nose and   mouth and if she
weren't so scared, maybe it would   have stopped her, but
it doesn't -- because somehow she   manages to maintain
balance --

-- and knees him all she has, in the nuts.

It's over -- Richmond falls to the floor, helpless.       He
lies on his back, holding his crotch.

But it isn't over. Christy, blood pouring down her face,
stands over him, the letter opener still tight in her
hand.

And in her eyes you can see it, the homicidal rage --

-- and she drops to her knees beside him --

-- and Richmond can only lie there, watching her --

-- and she gets a better grip on the letter opener --

-- and Richmond still only lies there, watching her --

                                                   (CONTINUED)



64   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              64

-- and she raises the letter opener slowly very high
above her head, the point aimed at his heart --

-- and Richmond screams one time --

-- and as Christy starts to kill him, two well-dressed
men in business suits burst through the bedroom doorway,
GUNS in their hands, and they BLOW HER BRAINS OUT before
the opener reaches Richmond's heart...


65   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                   65

Luther, in SLOW MOTION and this is what he does --

-- he reels back in the chair, eyes wide, jaw slack,
mouth open --

-- this is a man who has seen everything but nothing has
prepared him for this --

-- his arms flop over the arms of the chair, his body
loses strength, he tries to look away, can't --

-- and this is what he sees --


66   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                          66

Christy, fighting for another instant of life --

-- no chance --

-- the two bullets have shattered her brain, her eyes
roll up into her head, the letter opener drops to the
rug, she collapses like a rag doll --

-- and blood is everywhere.


67   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                   67

Luther. Back in regular motion now.    Pale, barely able
to breathe.


68   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                          68

The two well-dressed men in business suits.

BILL BURTON is the more formidable. Mid-40s, he looks
like a retired tight end. No body fat. Intimidating.
But right now he is shaking and he can't stop it. He
puts his gun away, goes to Richmond.

                                                   (CONTINUED)



68   CONTINUED:                                                   68

TIM COLLIN is closing in on 30. Handsome. In wonderful
shape. Burton is more physical, Collin more lethal. He
puts his gun away, goes to Christy.

Richmond is trying to sit. He is as drunk as before but
now he is also close to shock. He reaches over, manages
to pick up the bloody letter opener.

                                RICHMOND
                  Kill her?

Collin, by the body, nods.

                                BURTON
                  No choice in the matter.

His words are efficient but clearly, he has been rocked.

Richmond, staring stupidly at the letter opener. He
drops it back to the floor, tries to stand, can't.
Burton helps him back to the bed. Which is when he
passes out cold.

Burton and Collin look at each other now.

                                BURTON
                  Jesus, Tim, what did we do?

                                COLLIN
                         (echoing Burton)
No choice in the matter.


69   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  69

Luther, staring at it all. The shock is still there but
so is something new: anger. And on that --


70   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         70

GLORIA RUSSELL moving through the bedroom door.
Russell's 40, well-dressed, attractive and very smart.
Now she sees what's happened, stops dead.

Now she moves forward, looks at Burton and Collin.    It's
very clear from the outset: these three are not
friendly.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



70    CONTINUED:                                                  70

                                 RUSSELL
                          (to Burton and Collin)
Do you realize what a shitstorm
we're in?
(beat)
Go on -- tell me.

                                 COLLIN
                   Nothing to tell. He screamed.

                                 RUSSELL
                   And you heard no sounds of
violence 'til then?

                                 BURTON
                          (beat)
Nothing we haven't heard before.

Richmond, on the bed, out. Russell studies his face as
Burton moves toward the telephone.

                              BURTON
                Maybe I should call the police
now.


      CLOSEUP - RUSSELL                                                *

                                 RUSSELL
                          (soft)
Bill?     Why don't you think about
that?
(beat -- starting to
move toward him)
Take a second and just think about
that.
(closing in on Burton,
furious)
Think... real... fucking... hard.


      BURTON                                                           *

He is strong enough to snap her neck with one hand.

                              BURTON
                       (backing away)
Probably not a good idea.

                              RUSSELL
                       (taking charge)
Okay -- here's what happened
tonight -- poor Christy came home
alone and interrupted a burglary.
That sound logical?



71   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                   71

Luther in the closet.    He nods.


72   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                          72

Burton and Collin nod, too.

                             RUSSELL
               We're going to have to sanitize
this place.
(shaking Richmond)
Alan, did you have sex with her?

Richmond, eyes barely open.

                             RICHMOND
               ... Don'... 'member...

                             RUSSELL
               Bill, you're going to have to
examine her.

                             BURTON
               I'm no gynecologist.

                             RUSSELL
                      (she takes nothing
from nobody)
I just made you one.

End of discussion.


73   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)                  73

A clock on the side table beside the three clickers.

There is the sound of a VACUUM -- it's later now.

The place is incredibly changed. Christy is lying as
before -- except now she is fully dressed. The bed has
been made with clean sheets. There is a large black
garbage bag that Collin shoves the sheets in, dumps in
Christy's jewelry. Burton is VACUUMING the rug.

Richmond is visible, still in terrible shape, finishing
putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom.

Everyone wears gloves.

Everything that is incriminating is gone --

                                                   (CONTINUED)



73   CONTINUED:                                                   73

-- except the letter opener, which has been put in a
clear plastic bag. Collin reaches for it, starts to dump
it in along with the sheets and the jewelry.

                                RUSSELL
                  I'll take that.

                             COLLIN
                      (surprised)
It's got their prints on it.

                             RUSSELL
                      (she holds out her
hand)
Thanks for sharing.

Collin glances at Burton, shrugs, hands it over. Russell
puts it in her handbag, puts the handbag on the bed table
when suddenly --

Richmond, careening into the room, wide-eyed, crying
out --

                             RICHMOND
               Gloria -- I killed her --

Russell, turning, shocked as Richmond bears down --

-- she holds out her arms for him, but he is staggering
and he collides hard with her, spins against the wall,
uses the bed table to try to steady himself.


74   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  74

Luther, stunned, staring.


75   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         75

What he's staring at: the letter opener has spilled from
her open purse and fallen behind the bed, out of sight.

Russell, calm, going to Richmond, starting to lead him
from the room --

                             RUSSELL
               It's all going to be fine, Alan.

                             RICHMOND
               ... But she's dead...

                                                  (CONTINUED)



75   CONTINUED:                                                   75

                             RUSSELL
               ... I'll take care of everything
just like I always do.
(to Burton and Collin)
Gentlemen?

She gestures to leave.

Burton and Collin finish up -- Collin grabs the large
plastic bag. Burton glances around one final time and
backs toward the door, vacuuming carefully. Then --

Collin stops dead.   He stares across at the bed table.


76   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  76

Luther, holding his breath.


77   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - BURTON AND COLLIN - NIGHT 77

                              COLLIN
               Shit.

                              BURTON
               What?

In reply, Collin dashes back toward the bed table, grabs
Russell's purse, snaps it shut, tucks it under one arm
and leaves.

Burton flicks the light out, closes the door.

The room is lit by moonlight now. Christy looks
beautiful and still. HOLD for a moment.


78   EXT. MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                            78

It's open and Russell leads a staggering Richmond
outside. Two dark Towncars are parked in the driveway.

Burton is behind them, turning off all lights. Collin is
last, with Russell's purse, the garbage bag. As he
follows them outside, he closes the front door firmly --
it makes a loud, solid sound.


79   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - LUTHER - NIGHT                         79

The sound is barely audible.   He has been looking at his
watch --

                                                  (CONTINUED)



79   CONTINUED:                                                  79

The watch face is illuminated in the darkness. The
second hand is fifteen seconds away from the top.

Luther takes a deep breath, waits in silence.

The WATCH face:   the sound is loud, like "60 Minutes."


80   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                    80

Burton and Russell moving with Richmond toward one of the
cars. Burton takes the man in his arms, leaving Russell
free to open the back door.

Collin dumps the plastic bag into the trunk, shuts it,
moves quickly so that he can get a decent view of the
road.

The road in front of the house. Empty. Collin hurries
to the Towncar where Burton is struggling to get Richmond
comfortably stretched out on the back seat.


81   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 81

The second hand on Luther's watch hits the top and he
moves into action.

-- He points the clicker at the door --

-- the door starts to swing open --

-- Luther, backpack in hand, strides quickly into the
bedroom, turns, points the clicker again and as the door
starts to swing shut -- Luther carefully tosses the
clicker back inside.


82   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - ARMCHAIR - NIGHT                      82

as the clicker lands -- dead-solid perfect --


83   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                        83

Luther, in the bedroom, moving to the nightstand,
carrying his backpack --

-- he slows as he circles the body of Christy Sullivan,
looks sadly down at her, continues on as we MOVE TO...

                                                 (CONTINUED)



83    CONTINUED:                                                  83

The bed table. First, Luther opens the drawer and                *
pockets the necklace. Tense, he kneels, probes behind            *
the table, reaches farther and then -- the letter opener!
In the plastic bag. Luther grabs it.

He rises, opener in hand, and goes to the far window that
has a view of the front of the house. He looks out,
grimaces.


84    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                    84

The cars are still there. Burton is visible helping
Russell in. Collin hands over her purse, closes the
door. He and Burton move to the front doors.


85    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                        85

Luther, going to the rear window. He opens the window
slowly and silently. He ties one end of the rope around
the leg of a heavy, wooden chest of drawers --

-- now he carefully plays the knotted rope out the
window.


86    EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY - TOWNCAR - NIGHT                    86

Collin heads to one of the Towncars. In the other Burton
and Russell are getting settled in the front. Richmond
lies in a stupor, stretched along the rear seat.
Russell --

-- a moment of relief. She breathes deep.    And as
Russell starts to open her purse --


87    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - KNOTTED ROPE - NIGHT                87

as it snakes down the brick mansion -- it reaches the
ground.


88    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                        88

Luther, putting his backpack on securely.

The window -- Luther glances out and down.


89    HIS POV - GROUND OUTSIDE SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT           89

Forty feet below.   And it's dark.



90    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                       90

Luther -- he doesn't much like this -- but taking hold of
the rope, he puts one leg out the window -- only the damn
backpack makes it complicated and he's caught for a
moment, clumsily trapped with one leg in, one leg out and
the backpack wedged against the corner of the window --

-- and at that moment, there is a SCREAM.


91    EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY/INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT                91   *

Gloria Russell, as every nightmare she has ever had comes
true -- the fucking letter opener isn't in her purse and
as she screams again --


92    EXT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - WINDOW - NIGHT              92

Luther, cursing to himself, forcing his way out the
window and it isn't easy, but he makes it and then the
rope slips in his hands and for one precarious moment, he
is in serious trouble and...


93    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                   93

The Towncar doors bursting open as Burton and Collin come
barrelling out.


94    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                              94

Luther, getting his grip on the nylon rope again,
starting to go down -- but it's difficult going for him.


95    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT                      95

Burton and Collin tearing into the house, Collin in the
lead.


96    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                              96

Luther in the night, thirty feet up, and he can hear
COMMOTION inside the house and he tries to go faster --

-- but it's not easy; the man is, after all, in his 60s
and he's dangerously high and his visibility is rotten,
so he's doing the best he can, but he isn't exactly
flying.



97    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                     97

Russell, standing by the Towncar, staring in at the house
and from the look on her face, you know she thinks her
life might be over.


98    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT                    98

Burton and Collin, racing up the second floor staircase
toward the top.


99    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                99

Luther, halfway down.


100   INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      100

Burton and Collin, tearing along the third floor
corridor.


101   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                101

Luther, ten feet off the ground now.


102   INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                102

The bedroom door, flying open.


103   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                103

Luther, six feet to go, three, and he lets go, drops the
rest of the way, hits the ground running.


104   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         104

Burton, racing toward the window, Collin goes to the
night table.


105   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                105

Luther, at the end of the house, turning a corner.


106   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         106

Burton, staring out the window and Luther is gone.

                                                  (CONTINUED)



106   CONTINUED:                                                 106

                              BURTON
                   Shit!

Collin, looking around the table and the letter opener is
gone.

                              COLLIN
                   Shit!

And without another word, they bolt out the door.


107   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                    107

Luther, crashing through the field.   He is in wonderful
shape --

-- for a man his age.

And he gives it all he has but is it going to be enough?


108   EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                             108

The Towncar as Collin yanks something out of the glove
compartment, and then he is racing off into the night
after Burton who is a few steps ahead.


109   EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY/INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT                109   *

Russell staring after them -- in the back seat, Richmond
is in a half-slumber.


110   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                    110

Luther, bursting out of the underbrush --

-- up ahead is the most dangerous place for him --

-- one hundred yards of open field.   He runs on.


111   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - BURTON AND COLLIN - NIGHT          111

as Collin catches up to the other man, tosses what he
took from the glove compartment.

Thermal goggles.

They put them on, on the fly and...



112   THERMAL POV                                                112

The world ahead of them as they see it: their FIELD OF
VISION now resembles a rough computer game. THERMAL
IMAGES register in red, everything else is dark green.


113   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - LUTHER - NIGHT         113

Beginning to tire now -- and he's only halfway through
the open field and...

Burton and Collin, behind him, can't see him yet, but
they are moving faster --

-- and Burton could probably destroy anyone in a fight --

-- but Collin can fly.

And he begins to leave Burton behind.

Luther, and twenty yards ahead of him are some woods that
spur him on, he pumps his arms, his body straining and
his breath coming in gasps and...

Collin, graceful and young and in fabulous shape and just
ahead is the open field and as he starts into it --


114   THERMAL POV                                                114

What Collin sees: a THERMAL figure; a man running out of
the open and then disappearing into the woods.


115   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - NIGHT                  115

The sight of the figure is enough to kick Collin into
overdrive and he has never run this fast as he crosses
the open area.


116   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT                      116

Luther, running through the woods -- he can hear THEM
now, and he knows they're closing on him and he glances
back --

-- and smashes into a fucking tree!... hard... and it
rocks him, drops him to his knees --


117   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - NIGHT                  117

Collin and he could be jet propelled.



118   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT                         118

Luther, forcing himself back to his feet and running
again, giving it everything he has left and he's dodging
through the trees now.


119   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - NEAR WOODS - NIGHT                    119

Burton, behind Collin, but he draws his gun anyway --

Collin, in the woods, and his gun's drawn too --

Luther, out of the woods and now his car is visible --

Collin, in the woods but they're coming to an end.


120   THERMAL POV                                                   120

The figure up ahead is approaching a car.


121   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                  121

Luther, throwing the car door open, ripping off his
backpack, tossing it inside, jumping in behind the wheel.


122   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT                         122

Burton.   Pulling up, gasping terribly.   He sinks to one
knee.

Collin, out of the woods! -- Still amazingly without the
least sign of tiring --

-- and now there is a sound:   a CAR MOTOR STARTING.


123   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                  123

Luther in his car, wheels spinning.


124   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT                         124

Collin has his pistol ready but it's impossible to hit
anything when you're running like this.


125   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT               125

Luther, in the car, GUNNING AWAY.



126   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT                         126

Collin.    Slowing.


127   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                  127

The car.    A swirl of dust.

The dust clears.

The car rounds a corner, is gone.


128   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - NIGHT                                 128

Collin.    He stands there, rips off his thermal goggles --

-- and surprisingly, he smiles.

Burton, getting to his feet, his breath still not steady.
He takes his goggles off too as Collin approaches.

                               COLLIN
                        (still the smile)
I got his license number.

Now on that --


129   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                          129

Russell -- back in the bedroom, with Burton and Collin
who are moving around constantly, checking the place out.
Things are just amazingly tense.

                               RUSSELL
                        (close to losing it)
Gee, guys, maybe it was the
bogeyman -- don't forget to check
under the bed --
(exploding)
-- You may have buried us! --

                               COLLIN
                 -- relax, I got his license
number, remember? --

                               RUSSELL
                        (whirling on him)
-- you think he's going to just
sit around waiting for us? --
Asshole --

                               COLLIN
                 -- take it easy, Miss Russell --

                                                    (CONTINUED)



129   CONTINUED:                                                      129

                                 BURTON
                          (trying for calm)
-- everybody shut up, all right?

He is staring at his reflection in the big mirror.      He
crosses to it, goes to his knees, studies the rug.

The rug -- indentations in the expensive carpet.

                                 BURTON
                   Oh boy...

Burton and Collin with a crowbar, working at the mirror.

The MIRROR; there is a TEAR and a POP and it swings open.


130   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                     130

All three going inside, looking around.    The chair, the
looted shelves. The truth thuds home.

Russell turns, looks out at the bedroom through the door.

                                 RUSSELL
                          (dead)
A two-way mirror.

Silently, they move out into the bedroom.


131   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                            131

                                 COLLIN
                   -- I better get cracking on that
license number --

                                 RUSSELL
                          (no anger now)
-- it's all we've got -- and he's
got the letter opener -- blood,
fingerprints -- Jesus, think what
he can do --

                                 BURTON
                          (a powerful man who
speaks softly)
-- the man is a thief -- a thief
who witnessed a murder --
                                 (MORE)

                       (gesturing around)
-- it looks like he stole a whole
bunch of money -- I'll tell you
what he's going to do.
(beat)
He's going to run like hell.

And on that --


132   INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY                                 132

The saddest eyes you ever saw.

It's the next morning and Luther is back at the same old
stand, looking at El Greco. The other art students are
there too. So are the suburban housewives.

Everything is as it was -- calm and peaceful --

-- now a museum guard moves into the doorway, scanning
the room.

Luther -- a quick glance over, then back to his
sketchbook -- and from that glance it's clear all is not
calm and peaceful.

The guard checks the room again.

Edgy, Luther still works away.

The guard leaves.

Luther gets set to do the same.


133   INT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                         133

Red, alone in his empty bar, sipping coffee.    It's before
the place has opened for the day.

Luther comes in the back.    Red slides the videocassette
over, Luther pockets it.

                                 RED
                   Jordan beat us at the buzzer.

                                 LUTHER
                   Bad night.

And as he turns, goes --



134   EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING AREA - DAY                         134

A YOUNG WOMAN parking her car -- a high rocky area above
the Potomac. Below, a jogging path is visible, full of
runners.

The Young Woman gets out, locks her car, starts down a
narrow walk toward the joggers.

She's in her mid-thirties. A good face.        And there's
something familiar about her.


135   EXT. JOGGING PARK - DAY                                        135

Luther, standing by the edge of the jogging path,
studying the runners. Now he registers something:       and
smiles.

The Woman in her mid-thirties as she comes jogging along.
She runs well.

Luther.   An imperceptible straightening of his clothes.

The jogger.    We realize who she is: the little girl in
the photo on   Luther's dining room table. All grown up.
Now her face   registers something: his presence. Her
eyes go down   to the path, she increases her speed.

Luther.   Waving, calling out.

                                LUTHER
                 Kate.
(as she runs on)
Kate.

She slows, hesitates, stops.

Kate, hands on hips, breathing deeply, moving to the edge
of the path as he approaches. The river flows behind
them. Runners pass by.

Beat.

                               LUTHER
                 Probably too late for me to take
it up.

She says nothing -- he gestures toward the path.

                                LUTHER
                 The jogging.

                                KATE (YOUNG WOMAN)
                 Ahh.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

Beat.

                                 LUTHER
                   Dumb way to start this, I guess.

Beat.

                                 LUTHER
                   Wanted to talk to you.

                                 KATE
                   About?

                                 LUTHER
                   Believe it or not, the weather.
(as she waits)
Nights are starting to get cold.

                                 KATE
                   That happens this time of year.

Luther speaks quickly now, his voice low.

                                 LUTHER
                   I was thinking of maybe
relocating. Someplace with a
kinder climate.
(nothing shows on
her face)
I just wanted to check it out with
you first...
(still nothing)
... you're the only family I've
got.

And on that --

Kate speaks quickly now, her voice low.

                                 KATE
                   Luther, you don't have me.

The last words in this world he wanted to hear, but you
can't tell from his face.

                                LUTHER
                   Kate --

                             KATE
               -- you know what it's like being
the only kid in show and tell who
got to talk about visiting day?

                                                      (CONTINUED)



135   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              135

                                 LUTHER
                   This move -- I'm talking
permanent, you understand.

                                 KATE
                   We don't see each other anyway --
we haven't seen each other since
Mom died and that's a year.
(a step toward him)
Look, you chose your life. You
had that right. You were never
around for me. Fine. But I have
no plans to be around for you.

And now she stops, turns away toward the path --

-- Luther can say nothing, watches her --

-- then she spins back --

                                 KATE
                          (louder now)

                   -- I don't believe you --

And on those words --


136   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                             136

Christy Sullivan's body.

We're back in the master bedroom but now there is a lot
of police activity -- people work around the corpse. The
place is covered with black fingerprint powder.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

SETH FRANK moves into the room -- Bogart at 40. Chief
Homicide Detective of Middleton County, Virginia but he
had a decade of top work in New York City. Bright,
funny, and tough enough for anything you want to throw at
him.

He kneels beside the body next to an older man. This is
the MEDICAL EXAMINER, fat and bored. Seth studies
Christy; sadly shakes his head.

                                 SETH
                   Christy Sullivan?

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                          (nods)
Wife of Walter -- most likely came
home and stumbled onto a
burglary --

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                   -- some burglary.

LAURA SIMON. Laura is early 30s, and the best lab
technician Seth has ever known, and he knew some good
ones in New York.

                                 LAURA SIMON
                   I wish my carpets were this clean.
And I can't find a single decent                        *
fingerprint.

                                 SETH
                   You serious, Laura?

                                 LAURA SIMON
                          (bewildered)
It's like Mary Poppins was here.

                                 SETH
                   Could someone have let him in?

                                 LAURA SIMON
                   Sorry, Seth, but the entire
Sullivan household went to
Barbados two days ago.

                                 SETH
                   Thank you for your support.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 LAURA SIMON
                   Wait -- it gets worse --
(moving to the door)
-- the shots came from here. If
she interrupted a burglary, she
should have been here --
(moving to the bed now)
-- she was killed where she is --
all the blood patterns indicate
that. But she was looking toward
the bed -- what in hell was she
looking at?


137   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - DAY                                      137

Seth says nothing as he and Laura go in the vault.      Seth
stares at the chair.

                                  LAURA SIMON
                   Looks like someone sat here -- but
I couldn't find any prints.
(lowering her voice --
indicating the one-way
mirror)
You think Sullivan holed up in the
chair and watched his wife
perform?

                                 SETH
                   I hope not --
(shakes his head)
-- he's such a great man.

He moves back into the bedroom.


138   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                             138

Another cop is working on the wall by the bed table where
a hole the size and shape of a bullet is visible.

                                 SETH
                          (as he moves past)
Careful digging that out.

The cop nods.

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                   Looks like he tried to strangle
her.

                                                     (CONTINUED)



138   CONTINUED:                                                   138

                                 SETH
                   So he tried to strangle her, then
went to the door and shot her from
behind?

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                   He also inspected her vagina.

Seth.   Stunned.

                                  SETH
                   He did what?   Why?

                                 LAURA SIMON
                   Maybe he couldn't remember if he
fucked her.

                                  SETH
                           (has to laugh)
A strong burglar with a weak mind
-- obviously another open and shut
case...

As he stares around, baffled.


139   EXT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APT. BUILDING - DAY                 139

A high rise. It's in a different part of Washington than
we've seen thus far. Afternoon now.

An old salesman type is trudging into the building. He's
slumped, carries heavy salesman type suitcases. He wears
a battered hat. As he goes inside --


140   INT. BUILDING - FOYER/MAIL AREA - DAY                        140

The salesman is opening a mail slot with the name
"Hawthorne" on the outside. A good bit of mail, most of
it unsolicited. Hawthorne pockets it, unlocks the foyer,
heads toward the elevator.


141   INT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY                                141

The elevator and Hawthorne slowly getting out, heading
toward a corner apartment, taking out some keys --

-- there are three locks on the door... he takes out
keys --



142   INT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APARTMENT - DAY                     142

Hawthorne walks in, puts the suitcases down, flings his
hat toward a long sofa --

-- it's Luther and this, we will come to learn, is what
he keeps as his safe house. It's neatly furnished,
modern and clean.

Now he moves quickly --

-- first he opens a suitcase -- it contains his full
backpack from the robbery --

-- then he opens a locked closet door, revealing a very
large and sophisticated safe. As he begins to work the
dial --


143   INT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APARTMENT - DAY (LATER)             143

-- the TV ON in the living room as he slides the video
cassette Red gave him into his machine. Everything has
been put away.

The TV as Michael Jordan is introduced to the crowd --

Luther sits, nurses a beer, watches intently...


144   INT. MORGUE - DAY                                            144

An old man silently weeping.

This is WALTER SULLIVAN, one of the giants of the era.    A
self-made billionaire. Remarkably, the man has few
enemies.

At 80, his body may be betraying him -- he was once
handsome -- but his mind is that of a young man.

We've seen him before -- in the wedding picture on the
wall of his mansion. With his young bride Christy.

He is with her again now, at the morgue. A sheet covers
her body. The toe tag is visible. Walter, shattered and
desolate, stares at her once joyous face.

PULL BACK to reveal --


145   INT. MORGUE - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY                         145

Seth Frank, studying Walter THROUGH a two way mirror.
Seth is moved at depth of the old man's grief. Anyone
would be. Walter slowly rises --



146   INT. MORGUE - DAY                                             146

SANDY LORD waiting in an anteroom as Walter enters...

Sandy Lord is Walter Sullivan's lawyer.     He is 60,
abrasive, powerful.

Sandy moves to Walter, gestures toward the front door.
Seth appears through another door, intercepts them.

                              SETH
                Mr. Sullivan? -- I'm Seth Frank,
senior homicide detective for
Middleton County --

                              SANDY LORD
                       (protectively)
-- my client is in no mood for
conversation, sir.

                              WALTER SULLIVAN
                It's all right, Sandy --
(looks at Seth)
-- you're in charge of the case?

                              SETH
                       (nods)
I have to ask some questions, but
it can be tomorrow.

                              WALTER SULLIVAN
                You want what, positive
identification? Yes, that was my
wife. Anything else?

                              SETH
                       (notebook in hand)
You'd been in Barbados for two
days?

                              WALTER SULLIVAN
                       (nods)
I took the entire staff down --
always do this time of year.

                              SETH
                But Mrs. Sullivan didn't come.

                              WALTER SULLIVAN
                She was, had it all planned, but
you know women, they change their
minds.

I'd been married to my Rebecca for
forty-seven years and when she
died, I decided I never wanted
that pain again. One thi
