     FADE IN:

Through the window of a moving vehicle, we see a series of
small, middle-class houses.  This could be any suburban street
in America.


     INT. CITY BUS - DAY

A boy is seated near the back of a moving bus.  This is TODD
BOWDEN, 15, as All-American as they come.  He stares out at the
other passengers indifferently.  Then something catches his eye.


     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY

     TITLE: SANTO DONATO, CA  FEBRUARY 1984

Todd pedals his bike down a quiet street and pulls up to an
unassuming bungalow set far back on its lot.  This is the kind
of house one would hardly notice driving through the peaceful
suburban community of Santo Donato.  Todd gets off his bike and
heads up the front steps.  On the way, he bends down to pick up
the L.A. Times.

Two signs, in laminated plastic, are secured neatly above the
door bell.  The first reads: "ARTHUR DENKER".  The second reads:
     "NO SOLICITORS, NO PEDDLERS, NO SALESMEN".

Todd RINGS the bell.  Nothing.  He looks at his watch.  It is
twelve past ten.  He RINGS again, this time longer.  Still
nothing.  Finally, Todd leans on the tiny button, staring at his
watch as he does so.  After more than a minute of SOLID RINGING,
a voice is heard from within.

                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)
             All right.  All right.  I'm coming.  Let it
go!

Todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle.
Then it opens.  An old man stands behind the screen.  He is KURT
DUSSANDER, a.k.a. Arthur Denker.  Mid-seventies.  Standing there
in his bathrobe and slippers, a cigarette smashed in his mouth,
he looks like a cross between Boris Karloff and Albert Einstein.
Dussander stares at Todd, who tries to speak, but suddenly
cannot.

                          DUSSANDER
                    (continuing)
A boy.  I don't need anything, boy.  Can't
you read?  I thought all American boys could
read.  Don't be a nuisance, now.  Good day.

The door begins to close.  Todd waits till the last moment 
before speaking.

                          TODD 
             Don't forget your paper, Mr. Dussander. 

The door stops.  Dussander opens it slowly.  He unlatches the
screen and slips his fingers around the paper.  Todd does not
let go.

                          DUSSANDER
             Give me my newspaper. 

                          TODD 
             Sure thing, Mr. Dussander. 

Dussander snatches the paper away and closes the screen door.
Quickly, almost imperceptibly, the old man's eyes survey the
area: across the street, up and down the sidewalk, the boy's
bicycle.

                          DUSSANDER 
             My name is Denker.  See?
(pointing)
Denker.  Perhaps you cannot read after all. 
What a pity.  Good day. 

As the front door closes, Todd speaks rapidly into the narrowing gap.

                          TODD 
             Bergen-Belsen, January '43 to June '43. 
Auschwitz, June '43 to June '44.  Then you
went to Patin. 

The door stops, still partly open. 

                          TODD (CONT'D) 
             After the war, you escaped to Buenos Aires.
From 1950 to '52 you were in Cuba, and 
then... From 1952 to '58... I don't know.  No
one does.  But in 1965, you popped up in West
Berlin, where they almost got you. 

The door opens wider. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Listen, boy.  I don't know what is the matter 
with you.  But I don't have time for this 
game.  Now, get out of here before I call the
police. 

                          TODD 
             Call them if you want. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Fine. 

The heavy door slams shut. 

                          TODD 
             It's okay by me Herr Kommandant.  I'm sure
the police would love to meet the "Blood-
fiend of Patin." 

In a flash the front door is open, so is the screen.  Dussander
is through the doorway and descending upon Todd with the rolled
umbrella raised to strike him.  Todd stumbles back against the
porch rail. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You get away from this house, God damn you! 
I'll beat you all the way home.

But Todd regains his composure quickly.  He brushes himself off
and levels his eyes at the old man who now hardly seems the
threat he was a few seconds ago. 

                          TODD 
             After 1965, no one saw you again... Until I
did.  Three weeks ago on the downtown bus. If
you want to call the cops, go right ahead.
I'II wait on the steps. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You'll do no such thing. 

                          TODD 
             I won't?  Listen, old man, if I want to start
screaming right here, I will.  If I want to 
ride down to the police station and bring the
cops back myself, then I will.  I will do
what ever I want.  Do you understand?
(pause) 
But if you like, I could come in for a
minute.  We could talk. 

Pause. 

                          DUSSANDER
             I'd be out of my mind to let an insane boy
like you into my home.

Pause. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Is that what you want, to come into my home?
So be it.  There is no arguing with crazy
people.

Dussander turns and steps back through the screen door.  He
stops at the threshold of the house and turns.  He is holding
the screen door open with one leg, the front door open with the
other.  He looks straight ahead.  A moment later, Todd steps
into the house. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY

Dussander's home is what you would expect of a single, poor, old
man.  Nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary.  Todd looks
around, perhaps half-expecting to find a Nazi flag or an oil
painting of Der Fuehrer hanging above the mantle.  But he
doesn't, and moves into the living room where an old picture of
a woman sits framed on an end table.

                          DUSSANDER 
             My wife.  She died in 1955 of lung disease.
At that time I was working at the Menschler
Motor Works in Essen.  I was heartbroken. 

Todd's attention drifts away and his fingers slip over to a
lampshade next to the photograph.  He begins to feel it as
though he were inspecting it for something. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Stop that! 

Todd jumps back a little but then recovers. 

                          TODD 
             Tell me, wasn't it Ilse Koch who made the
lampshades out of human skin?

                          DUSSANDER 
             Now I don't know what you're talking about. 

                          TODD 
             Sure you do, Mr. Dussander. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Denker.  Denker.  Denker.  You don't listen,
boy.  The television has fried your brain. 

Pause. 

                          TODD 
             Your hands are shaking. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Yes, they're shaking.  I'm old.  We all 
shake.  You are most tiresome, and rude.  Now
if you have a point I wish you'd come to it. 

                          TODD 
             We're in no rush.  If I thought you had 
plans, I'd say cancel them, but since I know
you don't... 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You know nothing of my business -- 

                          TODD 
             What business?  You sit in that ugly chair
and watch soap operas all day.  Except on 
Friday afternoons when you walk down to the 
movie theater.  And twice a week you take the
bus downtown to do your shopping.  You always
use the express lane because you never have 
more than ten items.

                          DUSSANDER 
             You have been following me?

                          TODD 
             Of course, I followed you.  You think I 
normally go around to peoples' houses and
accuse them of being Nazi fugitives? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Perhaps for me you made an exception. 

                          TODD 
             No, for you I had to be sure.  For Kurt
Dussander I had to be absolutely certain.
...Now, I am, and that's why I'm here. 

Todd sits on the sofa. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Oh, yes, I see now.  As I am this ex-Nazi
fellow, as you say, then this must be the
part where I offer you my hidden stash of
gold, taken from the mouths of old Jewish 
men, of course, which I keep buried in the 
basement.  Isn't that right, boy?  Well, I'm
afraid you're wasting your time. I have no 
money.  If I did I might even give you some
just to be done with this nonsense. 

                          TODD 
             I don't need money.  You don't have any 
anyway.  At least, I don't think so.  You
probably had to spend it all to sneak in the
country.  A good American passport is 
expensive on the black market, that I know. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Do you?  Good for you. 

                          TODD 
             Yes, I do.  I know it all, Dussander.  You're
my One Great Interest. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Your what? 

                          TODD 
             My One Great Interest.  Well, not you 
personally, but, ...well, it's something I 
learned back in eighth grade.  Our teacher,
Miss Harmon, she said we'd have to find our
One Great Interest in life.  You know, the 
thing that would really grab us.  Once we did
that, everything would fall into place.  Like
hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but 
collecting nineteenth-century postcards.  I
guess there's no money in that, so she has to 
be a teacher.  Anyway, she told us to start
thinking about it.  So I did, but nothing
happened.  Until the following summer, in 
Ronny Pegler's garage.  That's where I found
it.


     INT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DAY

Todd and RONNY, both 13, rummage through several large boxes in 
the corner of the garage.  We see that the boxes are filled with
old war magazines.  Ronny tosses several of them to the ground 
as he digs for his dad's old copies of Penthouse.  Ronny selects
one Penthouse and rifles through it.  He discards it a moment
later. 

                          RONNY 
             One of these has three girls doing it 
same time.

But the old war magazines catch Todd's attention.  He picks one
up curiously and carefully flips through the tattered pages.  We
see a few of the photographs:  Nazi storm troopers, prisoners
behind barbed wire, the ovens.

                          RONNY (CONT'D) 
             I got it!  Check this out. ...Todd, look. 

                          TODD 
             Hang on a sec. 

As young Todd stares into this secret world, his voice comes
in...

                          TODD (CONT'D) 
             It was all there... pictures of stuff I'd 
never seen, stuff they never put in the books
anymore, especially the ones they give us to
read.  And here were stacks of them. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Todd speaks excitedly.  Dussander, very bored, clearly indulges
him.

                          TODD 
             It... 
Harmon said.  I couldn't believe it.  But
there it was, the camps, the uniforms, the 
...the way they saluted each other.  But what
am I telling you for?  You know more about
this stuff than anybody. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Yes, what are you telling me for? 

                          TODD 
                    (ignoring him) 
Then last year I wrote my big term paper on 
Dachau.  I got an A+.  It was the only A+ she
gave.  I mean I always do real well.  A's on
everything.  That's why I'm accelerated. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Accelerated? 

                          TODD 
             You know, accelerated.  I skipped two grades,
second and ninth.  I didn't need them.
That's why I'm already a junior. 

Dussander sits. 

                          DUSSANDER
             I see...

                          TODD 
             Some kids resent me for it.  That's not 
important.  Anyway, my paper really floored
my history teacher.  I guess because I got 
through all those books without throwing up.
But I learned something.  I learned that when
you talk about the camps now, you have to 
remember to sound really disgusted.  I mean,
you can't just say what happened like the
magazines did and leave it at that.  If I 
tried that the teacher would have freaked and
called my parents in. 


     INT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DUSK

Todd sits on one of the boxes surrounded by dozens of the old
magazines.  The door to the house opens and Ronny, looking
cross, pokes his head out. 

                          RONNY 
             Todd, your mom's on the phone.  She says you
have to come home for dinner.  ...Todd? 

Todd, lost in the sea of old photographs, doesn't notice Ronny
at first.  Then he looks up at him.  In his eyes is a glint of a
darkness that we will come to know better. 

                          TODD
             What? 

                          RONNY 
                    (suddenly wary of Todd)
Your mom's on the phone. 

ANGLE on Todd. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

                          TODD 
             Nowadays you have to... soften it. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Why do I care about this?

                          TODD 
             Because, I don't want it softened. 

Todd hops up and begins to pace the floor. Dussander stares at
him blankly, unsure of where this is going. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             I am sure you trouble your parents to no end. 

                          TODD
             Actually, I'm pretty low maintenance.  That's
what my dad says. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You told your parents about me, then? 

                          TODD 
             You think I'm crazy? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             I think you're crackers, but go on.  I'm
riveted.

Todd looks deep into Dussander's eyes.  Dussander is
uncomfortable.  Slowly, Todd reaches out and brushes his finger
against Dussander's hand.  Dussander gets up. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             What are you doing? 

Pause. 

                          TODD 
             And then it happened... I was on my way to
the library.  It was raining... 


FLASHBACK: INT. CITY BUS - DAY

Todd's voice narrates what we are seeing.  Todd, seated near the
back of the bus, watches Dussander climb aboard.  Todd thinks
nothing of it at first, but soon finds that he is unable to take
his eyes off him.  Todd is trying to place the old man's face in
his mind... 

                          TODD (V.O.)
             You climbed on the bus and started this slow
walk down the aisle.  Just like you were 
examining a new batch of inmates.  I don't
think anybody gave you a second glance but 
me, but somehow ...people seemed to move out
of your way.  And under your arm you carried
a rolled up umbrella.  But what really did 
it, what really set me off was the coat.  You
were wearing this long black rain coat.  My
mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of
you taken at Patin.  You in your S.S. 
greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

                          TODD 
             It was incredible. 

Dussander stares back at him flatly. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             All of this... because of a rain coat? 

                          TODD 
             Well, it wasn't 
really check up on it.  And every picture of
you in those books is forty years old, at 
least.  I went back to the library to find 
the picture.  And then I matched it with the
photos I took.

                          DUSSANDER 
             You took photographs of me? 

                          TODD 
             Yeah, I got this little camera.  Fits right
in the palm of my hand.

                          DUSSANDER 
                    (crunches cigarette into ashtray) 
Clever boy.

                          TODD
             But even then I couldn't be sure.  I needed
real proof.  So I went to the mall and bought
a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a
book that tells you what you're supposed to
look for and then dusted your mailbox while
you were at the movies.  Pretty smart, huh? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You... put dust on my mailbox?  For 
fingerprints?  You took photographs of me? 
What else did you do?... I don't believe any
of this. 

                          TODD 
             I already had a copy of your fingerprints. 
They're on your want sheet from the Israeli
government.  It's on database at UC Irvine.
Can you believe that? 

                          DUSSANDER
             Bourbon. 

He storms toward the kitchen and stops. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Would you care for a drink, boy? 

                          TODD 
             Sure, you got a Coke? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             No 

                          TODD
             Milk? 

                          DUSSANDER
             Milk. 

Dussander disappears into the kitchen.  Todd stands alone in the
living room. 

He lets out a long, nervous breath, showing for the first time 
the presence of something other than the cold confidence he has
been putting up for Dussander.  He knows he has crossed into
dangerous territory from which there is no going back.  But 
after a moment he composes himself; he has come this far.  The
sternness returns to his eyes.  Todd is all business.  He takes
a breath, and then speaks loudly enough for Dussander to hear
him in the kitchen. 

                          TODD 
             It takes eight good matches, they're called 
compares, actually, for a fingerprint to get 
accepted in court. 

                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)
             Is that right? 


FLASHBACK: EXT. DUSSANDER'S FRONT PORCH - DAY

Todd steps up onto the porch and looks around calmly.  He pulls
the powder and brush from his pocket and begins to examine the
mailbox for prints. 

                          TODD (V.O.)
             Yeah, there were two sets of prints.  The 
first I figured were the mailman's.  Once I 
knew what I was looking for, yours were easy
to spot. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)
             You should be a detective. 

The SOUNDS of a refrigerator opening and closing come from the 
kitchen.  Drinks being poured.  Todd begins to move slowly
toward the kitchen. 

                          TODD 
             Maybe I will... Mom thinks I'd be good at it. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY

He reaches the doorway just as Dussander turns around with the drinks. 

                          TODD 
             I found fourteen compares. 

Dussander approaches him carrying a tumbler of milk and a glass
of bourbon.  He hands the tumbler to Todd, who brings it up to
his lips and hesitates. 

                          TODD (CONT'D)
             You have some. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Good 

He snatches the cup and swallows twice. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             You see?  It's milk, boy.  From Dairylee
Farms.  On the carton is a picture of a
smiling cow. 

Todd pauses and then begins to drink. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) 
                    (more to himself than Todd)
...And two missing children.
(pause) 
Boy what you have done, I have to explain
this to you because clearly you don't
understand, what you have done is a
violation. 

                          TODD
             A violation? 

                          DUSSANDER
             Yes. 

                          TODD 
             Kind of like those experiments with the
decompression chamber.  Now, that was a
violation, Dussander. 

                          DUSSANDER
             That fucking name.  Enough of that.  I demand
it. 

                          TODD 
             You what? 

                          DUSSANDER
             I demand -- 

                          TODD 
             You demand nothing from me.  Ever.  Get it?

Pause. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Boy, I will tell you this once more, and for 
the last time.  My name is Arthur Denker.  It
has never been anything else.  It has never
even been Americanized.  If you must know,
and apparently you must, I was named by my
father who greatly admired the stories of
Arthur Conan Doyle.  I did serve in the 
reserves, I admit, and in the late thirties, 
when I was first married, I supported Hitler.
I supported him most, I suppose, because for
the first time in years there was work and
there was tobacco. ...Would you like a 
cigarette? 

                          TODD 
             No.  My dad used to smoke.  Mom made him
quit.  Now he's addicted to Nicorette...
that's nicotine gum. 

Dussander turns toward the counter and pulls a kitchen match
from a cabinet.  He lights his cigarette with his back to Todd. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Nicotine gum. 

Dussander's eyes drift to the collection of kitchen knives 
neatly stuffed in their block on the counter in front of him. 
He lingers a moment, pulls deeply on the cigarette, then turns
and continues.

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) 
             Anyway, Hitler lost his mind at the end, 
directing phantom armies at the whim of his 
astrologer.  He even gave his dog, Blondi, a 
death capsule.  On May 2nd, 1945, my regiment
surrendered to the Americans.  I remember
that a private named Gonzales gave me a
chocolate bar.  I wept. 

Bored, Todd sinks into a chair at the table.

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             I was interned at Essen where I was treated
very well.  We listened to the Nuremberg
trials on the radio and when Goering 
committed suicide, I bought half a bottle of
schnaps and got drunk.  When I was released, 
I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works
until I retired in 1963.  In 1967 I emigrated
here, to California, and became a U.S. 
Citizen.  I am as American as you are.  I 
vote.  No Buenos Aires, no Berlin, no koo-ba.
And that's it, my whole story.  I hope you're
satisfied. But if not, it's, as you say, 
tough shit for you.  Now, you go.  Enough of
this.

Dussander points to the door, but Todd remains motionless in his
chair.

                          TODD 
             That was pretty good.  So much to remember. 
But I guess it helps when you have forty
years to practice your story.

                          DUSSANDER 
             Oh, to hell with this and to hell with you. 
I'm calling the police.  Your father is 
going to beat your behind when he picks you
up at the police station. 

                          TODD 
             No.  My parents don't believe in violence. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Well, they should start.  I'm calling. 

Dussander steps past Todd and picks up the receiver of the phone
hanging on the wall above the table.  The boy still sits
motionless behind him.  Dussander dials a "9", and then, with 
more difficulty, a "1".  He stands with his finger poised over 
the final "1".  Tiny beads of sweat roll over his forehead.  His
shoulders drop.  Todd stands up.  Their faces are close
together. 

                          TODD
             Hang up the phone. 

                          DUSSANDER
             This is unforgivable.  Do you know the things
you're accusing me of? 

                          TODD
             Do it. 

Slowly, Dussander brings the receiver down onto its hook.

                          DUSSANDER 
             If you don't want money, what do you want? 

                          TODD 
             I want to hear about it. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Hear about what? 

                          TODD 
             The camps. Everything.  The experiments. The
examinations.  All the stuff the writers are
scared to put in their books because people 
will think they're sick.  That's what I want,
...everything. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Everything? 

                          TODD 
             Exactly.  And you're going to tell it to me. 

                          DUSSANDER
             You're a monster. 

                          TODD 
             According to history you're the monster. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             How could you ask me to remember such things?
I can barely remember to take my heart
medicine. 

                          TODD 
             You were there.  You did those things.  No
one can tell it better than you can.  And you
will tell it, starting today.  Right now.  If
you don't, I'll tell everyone who you are.  I
swear it. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Why should I?  Why should I do any of it? 

                          TODD 
             Because you hung up the phone.  That's why.
...And just so you know, just so there is no 
misunderstanding whatsoever.  Everything I
have on you, the compares, the want sheet,
all the photographs, are all in an envelope 
under my mattress.  I'm going to put it there
every time I come to see you.  If anything
happens to me, if I should suddenly 
disappear, some one will find it.  Believe
me -- 

                          DUSSANDER 
             That's a foolish thing to do.  What if your 
mother goes in your room anyway?  What if she
hires a maid? 

                          TODD 
             You better hope she doesn't.
(looking at watch) 
We're wasting time.  Let's get started.  I
have to be home for dinner. Today I want to
hear about the ovens.  How you baked them
after they were dead... and before. 

Pause. 

                          DUSSANDER 
                    (to himself)
A boy... a boy...

                          TODD 
             But before we start, put your teeth in.  You
look better with your teeth. 


     EXT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DUSK

It is later the same day.  Todd emerges from the house.  The
setting sun tells us he has been inside for several hours.  He
picks up his bike and hops on.  He stops.  He turns to look up
the street in both directions.  No one.  A moment later he
pedals off down the street. 


     MAIN TITLES


     INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

     TITLE: SEPTEMBER 1984

A typical high school image.  Rows of students sit listening to 
a lecture from MR. PROXMIRE, fifties, as he weaves his way
through the aisles. 

                          PROXMIRE 
             But in 1902, Panama didn't exist.  The 
country we know as Panama was part of
Columbia. 

As the teacher continues to lecture, the camera stops on JOEY,
17.  On his desk is a folded note. He hands it across the aisle 
and motions for it to be sent to Todd a few rows over.  The note
moves across the room, avoiding the meandering teacher, on its
way to Todd.

                          PROXMIRE (CONT'D) 
             Now the nations of the west knew they needed
a canal through Central America.  They were
tired of waiting for their ships to sail 
around Cape Horn.  This was the new century,
the age of modernization.  And the U.S. was 
at the forefront.  Teddy Roosevelt was in the
White House, looking for any chance to assert
the might of America.  When Columbia balked
at the offer made by the U.S. and England, 
Roosevelt sent his naval war ships to sit off
the coast of Panama, just sit there, where
they could be seen from the coast. 

The FEMALE STUDENT across the aisle from Todd now has the note.
She whispers to him but he doesn't hear.  Todd is trying to say
awake with great difficulty.

The girl extends the note just as Proxmire passes.  He stops,
turns around, plucks the note from the girl's hand and heads for
the front of the class. 

                          PROXMIRE (CONT'D) 
             Finally Columbia gave up the territory for 
about a tenth of its original price.  And as
Roosevelt would say later, "The U.S. stole
the Panama canal fair and square."

Without glancing at it, Proxmire crumples the note and drops it
into the waste basket by his desk. 


     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY

It is in between classes.  The denizens of STUDENTS crowd around
their lockers.  Among them is Todd.  He searches through his
locker and selects a book.  Suddenly the door SLAMS shut to 
reveal the face of Joey standing against the lockers.  Todd,
startled, jumps back. 

                          JOEY
                    (laughs) 
Take it easy, Jesus.  It's just me, flinch-
man. 

                          TODD 
                    (serious)
Don't do that. 

                          JOEY 
             I got news for you.  You're gonna like it. 

                          TODD 
             Walk with me to French. 

The two walk down the corridor.

                          JOEY 
             Someone likes you.  Someone good. 

                          TODD
             Who? 

                          JOEY 
             Well, I heard my sister talking on the phone
with Lisa Herman, and... well -- 

                          TODD
             You going to tell me who it is? 

Two CHEERLEADERS pass them.

                          JOEY 
                    (lowering voice) 
You didn't hear it from me. 

                          TODD
             Fine. 

                          JOEY
             Becky Trask. 

                          TODD
             Was that so hard? 

                          JOEY 
             So ask her out and the weekend after next you
can double with me and Vanessa. 

                          TODD 
             What about this weekend? 

                          JOEY 
             I'm already planning on being grounded. 

                          TODD 
             Grounded?  What for? 

                          JOEY 
             Where the hell you been?  Report cards were
sent out today.  I know that never affects 
you... 

They arrive at the door of Todd's classroom as the BELL SOUNDS.

                          JOEY (CONT'D) 
             Shit.  Don't forget what I told you. 

Joey runs off, leaving Todd looking after him. 


     EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - DAY

     TITLE: OCTOBER 1984

It is late afternoon.  Dussander sits in a rocking chair facing 
out into the backyard.  Todd is in the lawn chair off to the
side.  He has just finished a McDonald's cheeseburger and is 
about to start another one.  Dussander eats a Big Mac, washing
it down with bourbon.  A large cat keeps jumping onto 
Dussander's lap while he is eating.  He brushes it away annoyed. 

                          TODD 
             I've never seen anyone drink bourbon with
McDonald's before.  ...So, How did the stuff
get to Patin? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             In railroad cars marked "Medical Supplies." 
It came in long crates that looked like coffins. 

                          TODD 
             That's fitting.  Was it always Zyklon-B?

The cat jumps into Dussander's lap again.  He throws it down,
this time harder.

                          DUSSANDER 
             No, from time to time we would be sent 
something else.  Experimental gases.  The
High Command was always interested in 
improving efficiency.  Once they sent us a
gas code-named "Pegasus."  A nerve gas. 
Thank God they never sent it again.  It...

Todd sits up a little, leaning in. 

                          TODD
             It what? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             It didn't work very well.  It was quite boring.

                          TODD 
             Bullshit.  You're lying.  What did it do? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             It killed them.  What do you think it did,
made them walk on water?  It killed them. 

The cat jumps up a third time.  This time Dussander picks it up
and tosses it a good six feet.  The animal hits the ground and runs away.

                          TODD
             Tell me. 
(slurps on his Coke)
Tell me. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             I won't.  I refuse.  Where are my cigarettes? 

He finds the pack and fumbles a cigarette to his lips.  He
lights it.  Todd watches calmly, giving the old man a moment to
collect himself, and then... 

                          TODD
             What did it do? 

                          DUSSANDER
             It made them dance. 

                          TODD
             Dance? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Like Zyklon-B, it came in through the shower
heads.  After a few seconds the prisoners 
began to leap about.  Some were screaming.
Most of them were laughing.  They began to
vomit and to... to defecate helplessly. 

                          TODD 
             You mean they... they... shit themselves?
...Woah. 

But Dussander ignores him, staring out into the yard as he
begins to remember more easily. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             They began to twitch all over and make high,
strange sounds in their throats.  At last
they collapsed and just lay there on the 
concrete, twitching and yodeling, with blood
streaming from their noses.  But I lied to
you, boy.  It didn't kill them.  Either 
because it wasn't strong enough or because we
couldn't bring ourselves to wait that long.
I suppose it was that.  I sent five men in 
with rifles to end their agonies.  These were
five men I trusted.  It would have looked bad
on my record to have wasted so many 
cartridges at a time when the Fuehrer had 
declared every cartridge a national resource.
I was always given high marks for efficiency. 

                          TODD
             Yeah, I bet. 

Dussander looks down at the remains of the meal in his lap. As
if his own story has suddenly disgusted him, he balls the food
up in its wrapper and shoves it into the paper bag. 

                          DUSSANDER
             How do you eat this crap everyday? 

                          TODD 
             Why didn't you just do the job yourself? You
carried a gun, didn't you? 

                          DUSSANDER
                    (incredulous) 
I was the commandant of the camp.

                          TODD 
             So you never killed anybody? 

                          DUSSANDER 
                    (getting frustrated) 
The entire world was at war, boy.  People died. 

                          TODD 
             That's not a real answer.  I'm asking about
you. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Boy, I was a soldier in a position of power.
You don't get to be there by selling ...girl
scout's cookies. 

                          TODD 
             I know what the SS was, Dussander.  Who are
you talking to?  It was a bunch of dumb, rich
kids who bought their way into the service so
they wouldn't have to go fight on the front. 

Dussander stares at Todd, wanting to say something.  Todd
shovels a few more fries into his mouth, then looks up and sees
Dussander eyeing him. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             That's enough for today, boy.  I beg you.
I'm tired. 

                          TODD 
             Yeah, fine.  That was good story though.  You
always tell them good, once I get you started. 

ANGLE on Dussander. 


DUSSANDER'S DREAM #1: EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY

Dussander is asleep in his bed.  A low groaning sound comes in
very slowly.  Dussander's eyes open.  He sits up, looks around,
sees that his bed is in the middle of a large open field.  It is
grassy, but certainly not beautiful.  Something is wrong about 
this place.

He stands out of the bed, wearing pajamas.  But it is cold.  He
takes the sheet and wraps himself in it.  The groaning is
getting louder, more human.  We have never seen him frightened,
until now.  He steps a few paces from the bed.  The groans have
becomes low screams.  There is no where to go.  Slowly, as if he
knows what he's going to see, he looks down at the ground.  It's
just grass.  But the human voices are now wailing desperately. 

His knees buckle, but he tries to fight it.  He reaches his 
knees and lowers his head toward the ground.  The white sheet
flows around him and blows off in a gust of wind.  The screams
are now at a feverish pitch.  His ear is inches from the grass
and his eyes, marked with unmistakable terror, are wide open
as...


     INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dussander bolts upright in his bed.


     EXT. OUTDOOR SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

RICHARD (DICK) BOWDEN, 38, is a taller, grayer version of his
son.  He stands over Todd's shoulder watching him shoot at a 
paper target.  He still has on a tie from work, but the knot has
been loosened and his shirt sleeves rolled up.  Both Dick and
Todd wear headphones and orange shooting glasses.  Dick chews
gum.  They are alone on the range.

Todd fires a few rounds from his father's .30-.30.  A strained
tension exists between the two Bowdens. 

                          DICK 
             You're tight.  Don't hold your breath so long.

                          TODD
             Forget it.  I can't concentrate. 

He pulls off his headphones in disgust and hands the rifle to
his father.  Dick takes it and begins to reload it for him. 

                          DICK 
             I know your upset.  So am I.  So is your
mother. 

                          TODD 
             These honors classes... they aren't as easy 
as I thought they'd be.  I totally admit it,
I didn't prepare enough.  I'm sorry. 

                          DICK 
             Well, fine, but now is not the time to slack 
off.  You got a chance to finish at the top of
your class--

                          TODD 
             Nobody wants that more than I do, Dad.

                          DICK 
             Well you haven't been hitting the books very
much. 

                          TODD
             I know... 

                          DICK 
             And seeing as you're not playing soccer this
year it's not like you don't have enough
time-- 

                          TODD 
             That still bothers you, doesn't it? 

                          DICK
                    (with difficulty)
No, son. If you weren't enjoying it, then
you shouldn't play.

                          TODD 
             I think it bothers you and you're not telling
me. 

Dick decides to take a shot himself.  He readies himself and
fires. 

                          DICK 
             That was lousy.  Here. 
(gives the gun back to Todd) 
I want to see your grades come up, buddy. 
That's all that bothers me.  And if you say 
you need more time to study, then that's what
we'll do.  The first thing is to cut out all
the time you spend reading to Mr. Denker. 
It's a nice thing to do, but it's not helping
our school work a bit. 

Dick is looking at his son, unsure if he has just seen a
contortion of rage on his son's face.  But Todd is cocking the
rifle and...

                          DICK (CONT'D) 
             Hey, Todd.  You still with me? 

                          TODD 
             Yeah... no.  Dad, don't do that.  Please.
Don't punish Mr. Denker for something that's
my fault.  I mean, he'd be lost without me-- 

                          DICK
             He'll be fine without you. He was fine before
and he'll be fine after. There's nothing 
wrong with wanting to help people, but you
gotta make sure you got yourself squared away
first. That's what matters. 

Todd turns to face his father, and speaks to him with a new
seriousness.

                          TODD 
             Dad, am I like other kids? 

                          DICK 
             Not by a long shot. 

                          TODD 
             Then trust me on this.  Don't lose faith in
me because I blew a couple of exams.  I will
get my grades back up.  In fact I've already
started.  Three days a week I go over to 
Freddy Tremain's for extra help. He's a wiz
at trig. But please, Dad, whatever you do, 
don't punish a helpless old man for something
that's my fault. 

Pause. 

                          DICK 
             Did you practice that in front of a mirror or
something?

Todd smiles.  Feeling his father caving in, he aims the rifle and 
squeezes off a round.  Dick keeps his eyes on Todd as he shoots.

                          DICK (CONT'D)
             Hey, he's not...?

                          TODD 
                    (it takes him a second)
...No.

                          DICK
             Just checking. 
(thinks for a moment) 
All right... We'll give your way a shot. If
you think you can do it, if you really do,
and your serious, then... okay. 
You really like the old guy, don't you?

                          TODD 
             I'm making a difference in somebody's life. 
It's that simple.

Todd aims the rifle down range and pulls the trigger.  The gun
jams.  Todd tries to move the lever but it gets stuck. 

                          DICK
             Okay, okay. 
(takes the rifle) 
Don't ever force it.  Watch. 

Dick begins to methodically unjam the gun. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DUSK

     TITLE: NOVEMBER 1984

Dussander looks shabbier than in previous scenes.  His clothes
and hair reflect an increasing disregard for personal 
appearance.  He goes to the basement door and, leaning carefully
over the steps, retrieves a fresh bottle from his stash, stored
precariously on some shelves leading down to the basement.  He
comes back to the counter and cracks the bottle open.  Todd's
irritated voice booms in from the living room.

                          TODD (O.S.) 
             Don't get too drunk.  We still have a little
while. 

Dussander mumbles contemptuously and then speaks so Todd can
hear him.

                          DUSSANDER 
             You don't have to do that, you know. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK

Todd has built a fire, probably the first fire Dussander's
fireplace has seen in twenty years.  The room is bathed in a
warm orange glow as the winter sun sets outside.  Todd uses the
poker to adjust one of the logs. 

                          TODD 
             Screw you.  I'm doing this for me.  This
place is freezing. 

Dussander comes back in with his drink and settles into his easy
chair, which has been positioned in front of the hearth.

                          DUSSANDER 
             Yes, it must be fifty degrees outside.  I'm
sure to you it seems positively frigid.

                          TODD 
             Why didn't you pay your gas bill?

                          DUSSANDER 
             It slipped my mind.  I will attend to it
tomorrow. 

                          TODD 
             Slipped your mind.  I noticed it didn't slip
your mind to stock up on a new case of
bourbon. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Leave me alone. 

Todd finishes with the fire and sits on the floor a few feet
away.

                          TODD 
             All right, so finish your story, because I'm
still not clear.  You cook up this stew, and
you bring the prisoner in, and you let them
smell it, and suddenly they tell you
everything? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Oh, don't misunderstand me.  Certainly with a
pistol pressed to their head, a prisoner 
would tell us everything we wanted to know, 
sometimes more.  But mine was a much more ...
elegant method.  Remember, it had been months
since they had smelled real potatoes
simmering over an open flame, and boy, when
that delicious odor hit their noses their
mouths would drop and out would pour an
account of every minor infraction their
friends had committed, I mean it was
magnificent...

                          TODD
             And you let them eat the soup? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Oh, we never promised them the soup in 
exchange for information.  We never mentioned
it at all. 

Pause.  Todd is impressed. 

                          TODD 
             Wow, that's really good, Dussander.  I mean
that's...
(pointing)
that's thinking. 

Dussander does not respond.  He gazes deeply into the fire.

                          DUSSANDER
             ...But, as the war pressed on, the time for
such civilized measures became a luxury.  I
remember by April of '45, we had barely
enough food to feed ourselves.  The sound of
the Russian mortars grew louder everyday, but
still, the train cars from France and Poland
kept coming.  This was a time of desperation.
The ovens burned day and night and still I
knew we would not beat the arrival of the
Russian forces.  Many of my men, the cowardly
ones, deserted during the night.  But the men
that remained, the same ones I had called
upon so many times, ...continued the work.
At first we thought a massive fire in the
main building would serve our purpose.  We
could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch
up to each of the windows.  But with so many
of them, we couldn't be sure the bodies would
burn properly.  We needed something
...certain.  Then a young, bright soldier, I
shall never forget his enthusiastic smile,
pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the
Western gate which had been used during
construction.  How perfectly simple it was.
The bulldozers carved a narrow trench, four
meters deep, down the center of the camp.
For two hours they dug until I realized we
may not have enough gas to finish the job.
So the inmates were given shovels and told
they were building a shelter from the
incoming artillery.  When they were done, I
immediately called for a practice drill and
three thousand naked bodies began to march
into the trench.  It took less than twenty
minutes to get them in place.  Quickly the
bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit
sending the piles of earth into the massive
grave.  Those who tried to free themselves
were shot, of course, but very few cartridges
were wasted that day.  The machines were too
fast.  Back and forth they went... packing
the dirt.  One by one the tractors ran out of
gas and my men had to scurry along with
shovels.  But by sunset... it was done.  I
gave the order to evacuate.  In the distance
the plumes of Russian mortar fire rose like
an approaching thundercloud.  But I knew that
no matter what happened, ...no one would ever
forget what we did here.

Dussander stares into the fire.  Todd, wide-eyed, is locked on
Dussander when...

The PHONE RINGS.

They look at each other, a bit puzzled.  Clearly, it does not
ring very often, and when it does, Dussander cannot help but be
apprehensive.

It rings again.  Dussander gets up and moves toward the kitchen,
Todd watches him go. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Hello? 
(Pause. Then with apprehension) 
Yes? ...No, no trouble at all. ...Yes.
...Yes, he's here. ...I see.
(his face softens) 
...Really? ...No, no plans. ...Ah, lovely. 
...My dear, I'd be delighted. ...Certainly.
...Of course I will. ...Yes, until then.
...All right. ...Good-bye. 

He hangs up and turns to Todd with a odd grin. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) 
             It seems I am to be your guest for
Thanksgiving dinner.


     INT. OLD TOYOTA CAR - ROADSIDE - NIGHT

Todd and Becky are in the backseat of Becky's car.  They are on
a date and have parked on the side of a road overlooking the
lights of their town.  At 16, BECKY TRASK, is an attractive girl
who has recently discovered that boys like her and she likes
them.  They are kissing in the back seat.  MUSIC plays on the
stereo.  Becky's blouse is unbuttoned.  She stops kissing Todd. 

                          BECKY 
             Is everything all right? 

                          TODD
             Yeah, I'm fine. 

Becky smiles to herself, unconvinced. 

                          BECKY 
             You're nervous.  I think it's sweet. 

                          TODD
             No... No, I'm cool. 

                          BECKY 
             Do you want me to do something else? 

Todd just stares at her.  He doesn't know what he wants.  Becky
decides for him.  She slides down out of the frame.  Todd is
startled at first, but lets her.  After a moment, he closes his
eyes. 


     EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Dussander sits in his rocking chair.  A small blanket drapes
across his lap.  He smokes a cigarette and holds a near-empty
glass.  On the ground beside him, there is a small bowl.

                          DUSSANDER
             Here kitty-kitty.  Here kitty-kitty. 

Out in the yard, the large cat emerges from the darkness and
moves across the grass.  It sees Dussander and, more 
importantly, the bowl next to him.  We see that the bowl is
filled with milk. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Come, puss-puss.  That's right.  I'll wait. 

Dussander sits perfectly still.  Cautiously, the cat moves
toward the porch. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) 
             That's right, puss-puss.  You can smell it
now, can't you? 

The cat creeps to the edge of the steps.  It takes them one at a
time.

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) 
             That's right, kitty-kitty.  That's right.

After a moment the cat edges up to the bowl.  Its tail twitches
nervously.  Finally, it begins to lick up the milk.  Dussander
crunches the cigarette out in his empty glass.  His movements
are slow and patient.  From under the blanket he pulls a pair of
yellow rubber gloves.  He begins to put them on.  The cat jumps
back for a moment.  Dussander freezes.  He waits the cat out. 
Soon the animal is back at the bowl.  Dussander continues with
the gloves.  He watches the cat's tail.  As the animal gets
comfortable, its tail flips under the rail of the rocking chair.
Dussander slams the chair back.  The CAT SHRIEKS.  Dussander
flips the blanket on top of the cat and wraps it into a tight,
squirming, HISSING bundle.  He stands out of the chair. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Gotcha. 


     INT. BECKY'S TOYOTA - ROADSIDE - NIGHT

It is later.  Becky sits behind the wheel.  Todd is next to her.
A different song is on the RADIO.  They sit for a moment in
silence, clearly uncomfortable. 

                          TODD
             I'm sorry. 

                          BECKY 
             It's all right.  Maybe you'll be more in the
mood later. 

                          TODD 
             I don't know.  That's never happened before. 

Becky lights a joint.  She takes a puff and exhales toward Todd.

                          TODD (CONT'D) 
             Can you blow that the other way? 

                          BECKY 
             Maybe you don't like me. 

                          TODD
             No, I do. 

                          BECKY 
                    (exhaling out the window)
Maybe you don't like girls. 

For a moment it is as though Todd's face were purple with rage.
But a moment later the expression is gone.  Todd turns away.
Becky sees that her comment has hurt him. 

                          BECKY (CONT'D)
             That was a lousy thing for me to say.  I'm
sorry, honey.

She kisses him on the cheek.  He nods reluctantly. 

                          TODD 
             Let's just go home. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Dussander bursts through the door with the bundle.  A single paw
emerges from the corner of the blanket and flails at Dussander, 
clawing him across the neck.

                          DUSSANDER 
             Oww, you mother-fucker. 

They move across the room to the stove.  With difficulty,
Dussander pulls open the oven door, revealing the glowing red
interior.  The animal SCREAMS and claws at Dussander's neck and
arms, escaping more and more from the blanket with every 
gyration of its body.  With a mighty shove Dussander plunges the
cat toward the opening, but the animal braces its paws on the
edge of the stove.  The two are deadlocked.  But Dussander's 
hands are too close to the heat.  He screams.  His grip loosens
just enough.  With a desperate cry, the animal charges up
Dussander's body, over his head, and leaps to the floor.
Dussander dives after it. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Come here! 

But the animal is too swift.  In a second, it is atop the
counter and out the open window above the sink.  Although
defeated and exhausted, Dussander cannot contain his excitement.
His panting gives way to a twisted, hearty laugh. 


TODD'S DAYDREAM: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

This is a 1940's laboratory.  Todd is in his boxer shorts.
Dussander is next to him, wearing a lab coat and his S.S.
officers hat.  Todd looks down on the examination table.  A
YOUNG GIRL, about 16, is held to the table with clamps.  She is 
naked, staring at Todd.  Behind the table is a glass window and 
behind that is another room where OTHER SCIENTISTS are
monitoring equipment.

Over Dussander's methodical voice, Todd's dream shows flashes of
what is being done: some sort of sexual experiment on the girl. 

                          DUSSANDER 
                    (to other scientists) 
Test run eight-four.  Electricity, sexual 
stimulus, metabolism.  Based on the Thyssen
theories of negative reinforcement. 

Dreamlike SOUNDS and images pass before us: Todd's breathing,
the girl's cry, electrical equipment, naked flesh, maybe
Todd's, maybe the girl's. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) 
             Subject is a young Jewish girl, approximately 
sixteen years of age, no scars, no
identifying marks, no known disabilities -- 

Inside the control room, a SCIENTIST monitors a volt meter, 
calling out the readings as Dussander yells for the voltage to
be increased.  As the meter rises, the girl SCREAMS more 
violently.  Perhaps her eyes roll back, her tongue flutters in 
her mouth.  Through all of this, the scientists call out and the
record heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, voltage, etc.
Todd's eyes close.  His breathing accelerates as does the motion
of his hips until... 


     INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Todd snaps out of his daydream.  His trigonometry class is
having an examination.  He sits at his desk, staring blankly at
the paper before him.  Most of the answer spaces are empty.  He
knows he is going to fail another test. 


     EXT. OUTOOOR SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

Todd is blasting away, rapid-firing the rifle down range at an
unfortunate paper target.  The protective headphones lay on the
counter beside him, as does his backpack.  He stops shooting
when a voice snaps over the P.A. speaker next to him. 

                          VOICE (O.S.) 
             You, on lane twelve.  You need to have your 
headgear on at all times. (click) And no
rapid firing.

Todd looks over at the man frowning at him from inside a small
booth.  Todd puts on the headgear, and after a moment, the man 
goes back to reading a newspaper.  Todd looks up and down the 
range.  One or two other shooters are concentrating on their 
targets.  Todd quickly hoists his rifle up and aims it at the 
man in the booth.  He snaps off a single dry round.  Todd smiles
weakly at the sound of the click.  Unnoticed by anyone, he turns
back toward the target, strangely comforted.


     INT. DINING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - DAY

Thanksgiving dinner.  All the Bowden's are there, including
Dick's parents, VICTOR and AGNES. Dussander sits at the head of 
the table, Todd next to him.  The family has finished dinner and
is having coffee.  Dick and his father smoke cigars.  Todd's 
mother, MONICA BOWDEN, still pretty at 36, pours Dussander some
more coffee. 

                          MONICA
             Todd loved that dog.  A lot more than Dick 
did. 

                          DICK 
             We all loved that dog. 

                          AGNES
             I remember when you had to put it down, Todd
cried for two weeks.  Just about broke my
heart. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Excuse, me, Mrs. Bowden.  Put it down?  I've
been here over twenty years but that's a new
one. 

                          VICTOR 
             Means put it to sleep, Victor.

Dussander still looks puzzled.  He looks to Todd, but Victor
jumps in.

                          VICTOR (CONT'D) 
             Well, it's how they kill it, Arthur. They do
it all the time at the pound, ...sick dogs,
dogs nobody wants.

                          MONICA
             It's very humane.

                          DUSSANDER
             I see. 

Todd shoots him a fiery glare that the others don't notice.

                          MONICA 
             Some more pie? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             As my departed wife used to say, 'One must
never overdo the sublime.' 

                          AGNES 
             It was delicious, Monica. 

                          VICTOR 
             Tell me, Arthur, if you don't mind me asking.
What did you do during the war? 

                          AGNES 
             Now don't get too personal, Victor. 

A quick moment between Todd and Dussander.

                          DUSSANDER 
             I was a student at the University until my
reserve unit was called in 1943.
(notices Victor) 
But we were not a combat unit, thank God.
Mechanical engineers.  Help me find my 
cigarettes, Todd.  Would you?  In those days,
not even the call of higher learning could
exempt an able body from military service.

Dussander's cigarettes are right in front of him.  Todd fetches
one and, bringing it to his own lips, lights it for him.

                          MONICA
             Todd Bowden!

                          DUSSANDER 
                    (laughs knowingly) 
My dear, I do apologize.  My hands are too
arthritic to strike a match, I'm afraid. 
Your son has been good enough to help an old
man with his filthy habits. 

                          MONICA 
             Well...as long as you don't inhale. 

                          TODD 
             Cigarettes are gross, Mom. 

                          VICTOR 
             Well, Victor, you were doing your part like
we all were, I suppose.  Of course, if you 
were in the Pacific Fleet I'd have to shoot
you. 

Everyone laughs, except Todd.

                          DICK
                    (to Dussander) 
My dad is very proud of the fact that the
Bowden men have hit every major conflict
since the Civil War. 

                          VICTOR 
             That's right.  Dickie served two tours in 
Vietnam.  Earned a bronze star and a purple
heart. 

                          DICK 
             It's one family tradition I'd like to put an
end to.  Todd and I blow a few caps down at 
the range every week.  That's all the combat
he needs.

                          TODD 
                    (perking up, offended) 
What's that supposed to mean? 

                          DICK
             Forget it. 

                          DUSSANDER 
                    (looking at Todd) 
Perhaps your son would excel in combat. 

                          MONICA 
             Todd could excel at anything.  Right, honey?

Todd doesn't answer.  His eyes are still on Dick.  Dick notices
him. 

                          AGNES 
                    (getting up, starts to clear some
dishes) 
Oh, let's don't even talk about this. I can't
stand to think of you boys fighting another
war.

                          DUSSANDER 
             The Purple Heart.  You were injured? 

                          TODD 
             He was knocked unconscious and woke up in a
hospital.

A long pause.  Dick is embarrassed and offended by Todd's stab.
He puffs on his cigar.  Agnes comes in from the kitchen and picks
up some more dishes.  Dick stands suddenly to help her.

                          DICK 
             Mom, let me get that for you. 


     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Todd and Dussander walk together in silence.  Todd is clearly in
a bad mood.  Dussander prods him.

                          DUSSANDER 
             You shouldn't be so hard on your father. 

                          TODD 
             Why don't you mind your own business. 

                          DUSSANDER 
                    (amused at Todd's short fuse) 
Boy, It's not so easy to raise children. Your
father does the best he can, I'm sure. Having 
his own father there is bound to cause some
anxiety on his part-- 

                          TODD 
             Oh, give me a frigging break, will you?  Look
who's talking to me, for Christ's sake.  And
what was that crap about the dog?  If you 
were any more charming I was going to puke. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Heavens, boy, wasn't that precisely the 
point?  I used the evening to our advantage. 

                          TODD


                          DUSSANDER 
             Certainly now they will offer no objections 
if you continue to come over and read to me. 

                          TODD 
             You sure take a lot for granted.  Do you 
think there's anybody forcing me to come over
to your scuzzy house and watch you slop up
booze all day?  Do you? 

                          DUSSANDER
             Lower your voice.  People will hear. 

                          TODD
             So what?

Dussander stops. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             No, nobody forces you to come.  In fact, you
are welcome to stay away.  Believe me, boy, I
have no scruples about drinking alone.  None
at all.

They start walking again.  Dussander turns up his driveway.
Todd follows.

                          TODD 
             You know, if they found out what you are,
they'd spit on you. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             I am sure they would have nothing but 
revulsion for me.  But what would they say
about you, boy, when I told them you had 
known about me for nine months... and said
nothing? 

Dussander unlocks his door and steps in.

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Come and see me if you please, and stay home
if you don't.  Good night, boy.

He closes the door. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY

     TITLE: DECEMBER 1984

Todd places a brightly wrapped Christmas present on the table in
front of Dussander, who looks at it skeptically. 

                          TODD 
             Go ahead, open it.  Wait, I better pull down
the shades, first. 

                          DUSSANDER
             What for? 

                          TODD
             Just to be safe. 

                          DUSSANDER
                    (getting up) 
To hell with this.  You open it. 

                          TODD
             Oh, relax, old man.  Sit down and open it. 

Todd opens the refrigerator and pulls out a can of Coke.
Dussander slowly sits back down. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You wrapped it yourself, I see. 

He begins to remove the bow, and then the paper.  He moves very
cautiously, as if the package might explode at any moment.

Finally, he removes the lid and his expression shifts from one
of fear to one of exasperation. 

                          TODD
             Merry Christmas!

We see that the box contains a replica of an officer's S.S. 
uniform, complete with hat and jackboots.  Dussander reads the
label.

                          DUSSANDER 
             Pete's Quality Costume Clothiers - Serving 
You Since 1976.

                          TODD 
             Go ahead, try it on. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Are you out of your mind, boy?  What makes 
you think I would put something like that on? 

                          TODD 
             I thought you'd like it --

                          DUSSANDER 
             Like it?  My God, you're a bigger fool than I
thought.  Maybe I'll put it on and do a 
little shopping downtown.  Is that what you
thought?  You stupid, boy. 

                          TODD 
             Don't call me stupid. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You... You know, you are correct.  
stupid one.  For months I have suffered your
indignities.  I have exposed my past to you 
while watching you stuff your face with those
wretched hamburgers.  I have stocked my 
refrigerator with Coca Cola and ding dongs. 
All for you, I have done these things and I'm
tired of it.  But because I value my life and 
my freedom, what's left of it anyway, I do
them.  But I'll die before I put this thing
on, you fucking piss-ant. 

                          TODD 
             That's enough.  You don't get to talk to me
like that. 

Dussander bangs the table.

                          DUSSANDER
             I should smash you. 

                          TODD
             Do it.  Please.
(pause) 
Indignities?  What you've suffered with me is
nothing compared to what the Israelis would
do to you.  Remember what happened to 
Eichmann?  You forget that, I think.  And,
you know, that's my fault.  I have let you
forget.  You have gotten comfortable with
this situation.  Well, don't you for one 
minute ever forget who holds the cards here.
Don't you ever forget that envelope under my 
mattress.  I tried to do this the nice way, I
tried to do something to please you, but you 
don't want it.  So fine, we'll do it the hard
way.  You will put th
