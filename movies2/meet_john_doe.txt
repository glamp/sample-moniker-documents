               based on a story by Richard Connell and Robert Presnell




                         Ext. Bulletin Office - Sidewalk.

                         Close-up: Of a time-worn plaque against 
the side of a building. It reads:




                         "A free press for a free people."

                         While we read this, a pair of hands 
come in holding pneumatic chisel which 
immediately attacks the sign. As the 
lettering is being obliterated,

                         Dissolve to: Close-up: A new plaque 
on which the lettering has been changed 
to:



                         "A streamlined newspaper for a streamlined 
era."

                         Cut to: Int. Bulletin outer office. 
Full shot: Of a mid-western newspaper 
office.

                         Med. shot: At a door at which a sign-painter 
works. He is painting HENRY CONNELL's 
name on the door. It opens and a flip 
office boy emerges. The painter has 
to wait until the door closes in order 
to resume his work.

                         Full shot: Of the outer office. The 
activity of the office seems to suddenly 
cease, as all eyes are centered on the 
office boy.

                         Med. shotpanning: With the office boywho 
has a small sheet of paper in his hand. 
He walks jauntily to a desk, refers 
to his paper, points his finger to a 
woman, emits a short whistle through 
his teeth, runs a finger across his 
throat and jerks his thumb toward managing 
editor's office. The woman stares starkly 
at him while her immediate neighbors 
look on with sympathy. The office boy 
now goes through the same procedure 
with several other people. All watch 
him, terror written in their eyes.


                         Med. shot: Toward CONNELL's office door 
where painter works. It opens and three 
people emerge. Two men and a girl. The 
girl is young and pretty. All three 
look dourful. The painter again has 
to wait for the door to shut before 
resuming his work. The two men exit. 
The girl suddenly stops.

                         Close shot: Of the girl. Her name is 
ANN MITCHELL. She stands, thinking, 
and then suddenly, impulsively, wheels 
around. Camera pans with her as she 
returns to CONNELL's office door, flings 
it open and disappears. The painter 
remains poised with his brush, waiting 
for the door to swing back. There is 
a slight flash of resentment in his 
eyes.

                         Int. CONNELL's office. Full shot: CONNELL 
is behind his desk on which is a tray 
of sandwiches and a glass of milk, half 
gone. Near him sits POP DWYER, another 
veteran newspaperman. ANN crosses to 
CONNELL's desk.



                         (on phone)

                         Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the 
dead-wood. Okay.





                         (supplicatingly)

                         Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't 
afford to be without work right now, 
not even for a day. I've got a mother 
and two kid sisters to . . .

                         Secretary enters. (Her name is Mattie.)




                         More good luck telegrams.



                         Well, you know how it is, I, I've just 
got to keep working. See?



                         Sorry, sister. I was sent down here 
to clean house. I told yuh I can't use 
your column any more. It's lavender 
and old lace![1]

                         (flicks dictograph button)



                         (over dictograph)

                         Yeah?



                         Send those other people in.



                         (over dictograph)

                         Okay.



                         I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty 
dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, 
twenty if necessary. I'll do anything 
you say.



                         It isn't the money. We're after circulation. 
What we need is fireworks. People who 
can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.




                         Oh, I can do that. I know this town 
inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.


                         She can get no further, for several 
people enter. They are cowed and frightened. 
ANN hesitates a moment, then, there 
being nothing for her to do, she starts 
to exit. She is stopped by CONNELL's 
voice.



                         All right, come in, come in! Come in!


                         (to Ann)

                         Cashier's got your check.

                         (back to others)

                         Who are these people? Gibbs, Frowley, 
Cunningham, Jiles

                         (to Ann at door)

                         Hey, you, sister!

                         Ann turns.





                         Don't forget to get out your last column 
before you pick up your check!

                         ANN's eyes flash angrily as she exits.


                         Int. Outer Office. Med. shot: ANN storms 
out. The painter again has to wait for 
the door to swing back to him.

                         Int. ANN's office. Full shot: ANN enters 
her office and paces around, furious. 
A man in alpaca sleeve-bands enters. 
His name is JOE.



                         You're a couple o' sticks[2] shy in 
your column, Ann.



                         (ignores him, muttering . . .)

                         A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys 
a paperand forty heads are chopped 
off!



                         Did you get it, too?



                         Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm 
sorry darling . . . why don't we tear 
the building down!



                         Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better 
finish this column.



                         Yeah. Lavender and old lace!

                         Suddenly she stops pacing. Her eyes 
widen as a fiendish idea strikes her.




                         Wait, Joewait!

                         She flops down in front of her typewriter.




                         (muttering)

                         Wants fireworks, huh? Okay!

                         She begins to pound furiously, her jaw 
set.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. Eyes flashing as she 
types.

                         Close-up: Of JOE, watching her. The 
wild look in her eye and the unnatural 
speed of her typing causes him to stare 
dumbly at her.

                         Med. shot: ANN bangs away madly. Finally 
she finishes. She whips the sheet out 
of the typewriter, hands it to JOE.




                         Here.

                         As JOE takes it, ANN begins to empty 
the drawers of her desk.

                         Close-up: Of JOE reading what ANN has 
written.





                         (reading)

                         "Below is a letter which reached my 
desk this morning. It's a commentary 
on what we laughingly call the civilized 
world. 'Dear Miss Mitchell: Four years 
ago I was fired out of my job. Since 
then I haven't been able to get another 
one. At first I was sore at the state 
administration because it's on account 
of the slimy politics here we have all 
this unemployment. But in looking around, 
it seems the whole world's going to 
pot, so in protest I'm going to commit 
suicide by jumping off the City Hall 
roof!' Signed, A disgusted American 
citizen, John Doe.'"

                         JOE pauses to absorb this.



                         (continues reading)

                         "Editor's note . . . If you ask this 
column, the wrong people are jumping 
off roofs."

                         JOE glances up toward ANN, in mild protest.




                         Hey, Ann, this is the old fakeroo, isn't 
it?

                         Full shot: ANN has just about accumulated 
all her things. JOE stares at her, knowing 
it's a fake.



                         Never mind that, Joe. Go ahead.

                         JOE shrugs, shakes his head, and exits. 
ANN stuffs her things under her arm 
and also goes.

                         Int. Outer office: Med. shot: Voices 
ad lib"Awfully sorry you're not going." 
"Good-bye." (Laughing)

                         ANN comes out. Suddenly, she stops, 
gets another idea, picks up a book from 
a desk, and reaches back to heave it.


                         Med. shot: At CONNELL's office door. 
The sign-painter has just finished CONNELL's 
name, and as he leans back, pleased, 
wiping his brushes, the book flies in. 
The painter lifts his head slowly, his 
wrath too great to find utterance.


                         Dissolve to: Int. GOVERNOR JACKSON's 
office: Close-up: Of two of GOVERNOR'S 
                         ASSOCIATES.



                         (reading newspaper)

                         " . . . and it's because of the slimy 
politics that we have all this unemployment 
here."

                         (agitated)

                         There it is! That's D. B. Norton's opening 
attack on the Governor!



                         Why Jim, it's just a letter sent in 
to a column.



                         No, no. I can smell it. That's Norton!


                         While he speaks, the GOVERNOR has entered.






                         Good morning, gentlemen. You're rather 
early.



                         'Morning. 'Morning, Governor.



                         You're here rather early.



                         (pushes paper over to him)

                         Did you happen to see this in the New 
Bulletin, Governor?

                         He emphasizes the word "new" cynically.




                         Yes. I had it served with my breakfast 
this morning.



                         Jim thinks it's D. B. Norton at work.




                         Of course it is!



                         Oh, come, Jim. That little item? D. 
B. Norton does things in a much bigger 
way . . .



                         This is his opening attack on you, Governor! 
Take my word for it! What did he buy 
a paper for? Why did he hire a high-pressure 
editor like Connell for? He's in the 
oil business! I tell you, Governor, 
he's after your scalp!



                         All right, Jim. Don't burst a blood 
vessel, I'll attend to it.

                         (flips button on dictograph)

                         Get me Spencer of the Daily Chronicle 
, please.

                         Dissolve to: Int. SPENCER's office: 
Med. shot: SPENCER is on the telephone.




                         Yes. Yes. I saw it, Governor . . . and 
if you ask me that's a phoney letter. 
Why, that gag has got whiskers on it. 
Huh? Okay, I'll get the Mayor and maybe 
the Chamber of Commerce to go after 
them.

                         (into dictagraph)

                         Get Mayor Lovett on the phone!

                         Int. MAYOR's office: Med. shot: Of MAYOR's 
secretary.



                         (picking up phone)

                         Hello? Sorry, the Mayor's busy on the 
other phone.



                         Camera pans over to the MAYOR who is 
fatuous and excitable.



                         (into telephone)

                         Yes, I know, Mrs. Brewster. It's a terrible 
reflection on our city. I've had a dozen 
calls already.

                         SECRETARY enters scene.



                         Spencer of the Chronicle .



                         Hold him.

                         (into phone)

                         Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.


                         The SECRETARY lays down the receiver.


                         Dissolve to: Int. corner of a bedroom: 
Close shot: Of MRS. BREWSTERstout and 
loud. She is propped up in beda breakfast 
tray on her lapthe newspaper by her 
side.



                         I insist that this John Doe man be found 
and given a job at once. If something 
isn't done. I'll call out the whole 
Auxiliary[3] yes, and the Junior Auxiliary, 
too. We'll hold a meeting and see


                         Cut to: Int. MAYOR's office: Med. shot: 
Of MAYOR. He lays the receiver down 
and we continue to hear MRS. BREWSTER's 
voice. MAYOR picks up SPENCER's phone.




                         Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, 
what about me? it's my building he's 
jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, 
too!



                         Shh!



                         (to Secretary)

                         What are you doing? Get Connell at the 
Bulletin !

                         (to Spencer)

                         Why, he's liable to go right past my 
window,

                         (suddenlyto Sec'yexcitably)

                         What was that?!



                         What?



                         Out the window! Something just flew 
by!



                         I didn't see anything.





                         (semi-hysterical)

                         Well, don't stand there, you idiot. 
Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why 
did he have to pick on my building?


                         The SECRETARY, telephone in hand, peers 
out window.



                         Is there a crowd in the street?



                         No, sir.



                         Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look 
again!



                         I think it must have been a sea-gull.




                         A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing 
around the city hall? That's a bad omen, 
isn't it?

                         (picks up Mrs. Brewster's phone)



                         Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely 
bird.



                         (into telephone)

                         I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It 
was just a sea-gull.

                         (catches himself)

                         Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm 
watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave 
it all to me!

                         The SECRETARY holds out another phone. 
The MAYOR drops MRS. BREWSTER's phone 
again, and her voice is still heard.




                         (into Spencer's phone)

                         Spencer, I'll call you back.

                         Secretary has gotten CONNELL on the 
phonehands phone to MAYOR.



                         Hello! Connell! This is

                         (to Secretary)

                         What are you doing?

                         (back to phone)

                         This is the Mayor.

                         Int. CONNELL's office: Full shot: CONNELL 
is on the phone. POP DWYER is draped 
in a chair nearby.



                         Yes, Mayor Lovett! How many times are 
you gonna call me? I've got everybody 
and his brother and sister out looking 
for him. Did you see the box I'm running?




                         He picks up the front page of the Bulletin; 
we see a four column box on the front 
page.



                         (reading)

                         "An appeal to John Doe. 'Think it over, 
John. Life can be beautiful,' says Mayor. 
'If you need a job, apply to the editor 
of this paper . . .'" " and so forth 
and so forth . . . Okay, Mayor. I'll 
let you know as soon as I have something! 
What? . . . Well, pull down the blinds!


                         (he hangs up)

                         The door opens and a man enters. His 
name is BEANY. Walks fast, talks fast 
and accomplishes nothing. Outside, we 
see the painter trying once more to 
get his sign painted. He reaches inand 
pulls the door to.



                         I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, 
boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.



                         Where is she?



                         Hey, do you know something? She supports 
a mother and two kids. What do you know 
about that?



                         (controlling his patience)

                         Did you find her?



                         No. Her mother's awful worried about 
her. When she left the house she said 
she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, 
the girl, I mean!



                         (barking)

                         Go out and find her!



                         Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't 
tell you . . .

                         CONNELL picks up telephone.



                         Hello! . . . Yeh?



                         Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, 
the doc that saved my mother's life 
and wouldn't take any money for it? 
You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll 
go and look for her.

                         BEANY exits, knocking over an ash-stand.






                         (into phone)

                         Holy smokes, Commissioner. You've had 
twenty-four hours! Okay, Hawkshaw, grab 
a pencil. Here it is again. She's about 
five foot five, brown eyes, light chestnut 
hair and as fine a pair of legs as . 
                         . .

                         The door opens, ANN stands thereCONNELL 
sees her.



                         (into phonestaring at Ann)

                          . . . ever walked into this office.


                         Med. shot: At door. The sign painter 
is slowly beginning to lose patience. 
He again reaches inpulls the door shutglaring 
at ANN.

                         Close-up: Of ANN.



                         (innocently)

                         Did you want to see me?

                         Wider shot: CONNELL, without moving, 
stares at her.



                         (quietlysizzling)

                         No. I've had the whole army and navy 
searching for you because that's a game 
we play here every day.



                         I remember, distinctly, being fired.




                         That's right. But you have a piece of 
property that still belongs to this 
newspaper. And I'd like to have it!




                         What's that?



                         The letter.



                         What letter?



                         The letter from John Doe.



                         Oh!



                         The whole town's in an uproar. We've 
got to find him. The letter's our only 
clue.



                         (simply)

                         There is no letter.





                         We'll get a handwriting expert to


                         (suddenly realizes what she has said)


                         What!



                         There is no letter.

                         He stares at her for a moment, flabbergastedexchanges 
a look with POPcrosses to the back 
doorshuts itthen comes back to face 
her.

                         Close shot: ANN and CONNELL.



                         Say that again.



                         There is no letter. I made it up.

                         CONNELL looks at her a long moment and 
then up at POP.



                         (repeating dully)

                         You made it up.



                         Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.


                         Wider shot: As he recovers from the 
shock, and then wheels on ANN again.




                         Don't you know there are nine jobs waiting 
for this guy? Twenty-two families want 
to board him free? Five women want to 
marry him, and the Mayor's practically 
ready to adopt him? And you . . .


                         As CONNELL glares at her the door springs 
open and BEANY enters.



                         I just called the morgue, boss. They 
say there's a girl there



                         Shut up!

                         Close-up: Of BEANY. He is startled by 
thisand then stares popeyed as he sees 
                         ANN.



                         Ann! Say, why didn't yuh



                         Beany!

                         Med. shot: At the door. The painter 
is beginning to grind his teeth. He 
pulls the door shut, viciously.

                         Wider shot: To include all.





                         Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the 
whole business quickly.



                         How?



                         Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, 
and is sorry he wrote the letter and




                         (jumps in quickly)

                         That's right. You got it! Sure! He came 
in here and I made him change his mind. 
"Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." 
Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write 
it up.

                         (into dictograph)

                         Oh, Ned!



                         Yeah?



                         I got a story I want yuh to



                         Wait a minute!

                         She rushes oversnaps the dictograph 
off.

                         Med. shot: Of ANN, leaning on CONNELL's 
desk.



                         Listen, you great big wonderful genius 
of a newspaperman! You came down here 
to shoot some life into this dying paper, 
didn't you?

                         CONNELL blinks under the attack. POP 
and BEANY move into the scene.



                         Well, the whole town's curious about 
John Doe and, boom, just like that you're 
going to bury him. There's enough circulation 
in that man to start a shortage in the 
ink market!



                         (thoroughly bewildered)

                         In what man!



                         John Doe.



                         What John Doe?



                         Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, 
genius Now, look. Suppose there was 
a John Doeand he walked into this office. 
What would you do? Find him a job and 
forget about the whole business, I suppose! 
Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!






                         A deal?



                         Sure! When you get hold of a stunt that 
sells papers you don't drop it like 
a hot potato. Why, this is good for 
at least a couple of months. You know 
what I'd do? Between now and let's say, 
Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd 
run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, 
his schooling, his first job! A wide-eyed 
youngster facing a chaotic world. The 
problem of the average man, of all the 
John Does in the world.

                         Two shot: ANN and CONNELL. Despite himself, 
he's interested in her recital.



                         Now, then comes the drama. He meets 
discouragement. He finds the world has 
feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So 
what does he do? He decides to commit 
suicide in protest against the state 
of civilization. He thinks of the river! 
But no, no, he has a better idea. The 
City Hall. Why? Because he wants to 
attract attention. He wants to get a 
few things off his chest, and that's 
the only way he can get himself heard.




                         So?

                         Full shot: Of the whole group. BEANY 
grins in admiration. CONNELL has leaned 
back in his chair, his eyes glued on 
                         ANN.



                         So! So he writes me a letter and I dig 
him up. He pours out his soul to me, 
and from now on we quote: "I protest, 
by John Doe." He protests against all 
the evils in the world; the greed, the 
lust, the hate, the fear, all of man's 
inhumanity to man.

                         Arguments will start. Should he commit 
suicide or should he not! People will 
write in pleading with him. But no! 
No, sir! John Doe will remain adamant! 
On Christmas Eve, hot or cold, he goes! 
See?

                         She finishes, takes a deep breathawed, 
and at the same time proud of her accomplishment.


                         Close shot: Of CONNELL. He just stares 
at ANN.



                         (after a pausequietly)

                         Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss 
Mitchell. But would you mind telling 
me who goes on Christmas Eve?



                         John Doe.



                         (loses controlscreams)

                         What John Doe?





                         (screams right back)

                         The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!


                         There is silence for a moment.



                         (breaking silencespeaks with a controlled 
patience)

                         Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme 
get this through this lame brain of 
mine. Are you suggesting we go out and 
hire someone to say he's gonna commit 
suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?




                         (nodding)

                         Well, you're catching on.



                         Who, for instance?



                         Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!

                         Close-up: BEANY. He is petrified.



                         Why sureWho? Me? Jump off aOh, no! 
Any time but Christmas. I'm superstitious.


                         Full shot: BEANY backs away from themand 
when he gets to the doormakes a dash 
for it.

                         Int. Outer office: Med. shot: At door. 
As BEANY comes dashing out, he almost 
upsets the painter from the stool. When 
the door is shut, the name of "Connell" 
which he has been printing is all smudged 
over. The painter stares at it, helplessly 
for a second, and thenunable to stand 
it any more, rises, throws his brush 
violently to the floorafter completely 
smearing the sign himself.

                         Full shot:



                         (sighing)

                         Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? 
Go on out and get married and have a 
lot o' babiesbut stay out o' newspaper 
business!



                         Better get that story in, Hank, it's 
getting late.



                         (to CONNELL)

                         You're supposed to be a smart guy! If 
it was raining hundred dollar bills, 
you'd be out looking for a dime you 
lost some place.



                         Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening 
to this mad woman.



                         He crosses to his desk just as NED enters 
from the back door.



                         Look, Chief! Look what the Chronicle 
is running on John Doe. They say it's 
a fake!

                         CONNELL turns sharply.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. She was just about 
giving up, when she hears thisand her 
eyes brighten alertly.

                         Med. shot: At CONNELL's desk. CONNELLreading 
the paperbecomes incensed.



                         Why, the no-goodlow-down

                         (reading)

                         "John Doe story amateur journalism. 
It's palpably phoney. It's a wonder 
anyone is taking it seriously." What 
do yuh think of those guys!

                         ANN has walked into scene while CONNELL 
is reading.



                         That's fine! That's fine! Now fall right 
into their laps. Go ahead. Say John 
Doe walked in and called the whole thing 
off. You know what that's going to sound 
like on top of this!



                         (doesn't like Ned hearing all this)


                         That's all, Ned. Thank you.



                         All right.

                         NED, puzzled, exits. CONNELL comes away 
from his desk and walks around.



                         (fighting spirit)

                         "Amateur journalism", huh? Why, the 
bunch of sophomores! I can teach them 
more about

                         But he is interrupted by the front door 
being flung open. On the threshold stands 
                         BEANY.



                         Hey, boss. Get a load of this.



                         (joins him in the doorway)

                         What?



                         Look!

                         Med. shot: Over their shoulders. In 
the outer office are a large group of 
derelict-looking men. Some standingsome 
sittingsome leaning. It looks like 
the lobby of a flophouse had been transplanted.


                         Close shot: Beany and Connell.





                         What do they want?



                         They all say they wrote the John Doe 
letter.

                         Med. shot: POP and ANN have walked over 
and also peer out.



                         (amused, turns)

                         Oh, they all wrote the letter?

                         ANN pushes CONNELL asidetalks to BEANY.




                         Tell them all to wait.

                         She shuts the door and turns to CONNELL.




                         Look, Mr. Connellone of those men is 
your John Doe. They're desperate and 
will do anything for a cup of coffee. 
Pick one out and you can make the Chronicle 
eat their words.

                         Close-up: Of CONNELL. A broad smile 
slowly spreads over his face.



                         I'm beginning to like this.

                         Med. shot: POP looks worried.



                         If you ask me, Hank, you're playing 
around with dynamite.



                         No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't 
let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! 
We've got to produce a John Doe now.


                         (muttering)

                         Amateur journalism, huh!

                         (starts for door)

                         I'll show those guys.



                         Sureand there's no reason for them 
to find out the truth, either.

                         (significantly)

                         Because, naturally, I won't say anything.


                         CONNELL turns sharply, stares at her 
a moment puzzled, then grins.



                         (grinning)

                         Okay, sister, you get your job back.




                         Plus a bonus.



                         What bonus?



                         Close-up: Of ANN. She takes the plunge. 
She is a little frightened at her own 
nerve, but she is going to brazen it 
out.



                         (tries to drop it casually)

                         Oh, the bonus of a thousand dollars 
the Chronicle was going to pay me for 
this little document. You'll find it 
says, er: "I, Ann Mitchell, hereby certify 
that the John Doe letter was created 
by me"

                         Med. shot: As she speaks, she gets the 
"little document" out of her bag, hands 
it to CONNELL who glares at her, takes 
the paper and starts to read. Ann leans 
over his shoulder. POP peers over his 
other shoulder.



                         I can read. I can read!



                         Sorry.

                         She backs away. CONNELL continues reading 
her confession.



                         So you think this is worth a thousand 
dollars, do you?



                         (very carelessly)

                         Oh, the Chronicle would consider it 
dirt cheap.



                         Packs everything, including a gun.


                         (flings paper on desk)

                         Okay, sister, you've got yourself a 
deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. 
The one we pick has gotta be the typical 
average man. Typical American that can 
keep his mouth shut.



                         Show me an American who can keep his 
mouth shut andI'll eat him.



                         (opens door)

                         Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.


                         (he steps back and rubs his hands in 
anticipation)

                         Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different 
types of hoboes appearand in each instance 
ANN shakes her head, negatively.

                         Wipe to: Close shot: Of a TALL CHAP, 
head hanging shyly.

                         Two shot: Of ANN and CONNELL. They are 
impressed.

                         Full shot: ANN and CONNELL exchange 
hopeful glances and begin slowly walking 
around the new candidate.

                         Close-up: Of TALL CHAP. He feels awkward 
under this scrutiny.

                         Wider shot: CONNELL stops in his examination 
of the man.





                         Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?




                         (after a pause)

                         No, I didn't.

                         ANN, CONNELL and POP evince their surprise.




                         What are you doing up here then?



                         Well, the paper said there were some 
jobs around loose. Thought there might 
be one left over.

                         They study him for a second, then ANN 
walks over close to him.

                         Two shot: ANN and TALL CHAP.



                         Had any schooling?



                         Yeah, a little.



                         What do you do when you work?



                         (slight pause)

                         I used to pitch.



                         Baseball?



                         Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.



                         Where'd you play?



                         Bush leagues mostly.[5]

                         Med. shot: To include the rest of them. 
They have their eyes glued on his face. 
ANN is very much interested.



                         How about family? Got any family?



                         (after a pause)

                         No.



                         Oh, just traveling through, huh?



                         Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's 
outside.



                         CONNELL nods to the others to join him 
in a huddle. He crosses to a corner. 
They follow.

                         Close three shot: They speak in subdued 
voices.



                         Looks all right



                         He's perfect! A baseball player. What 
could be more American!



                         I wish he had a family, though.



                         Be less complicated without a family.




                         Look at that face. It's wonderful. They'll 
believe him . Come on.

                         Close-up: Of TALL CHAP. He is a strange, 
bewildered figure. He knows he is being 
appraised, but doesn't know why. He 
fingers his hat nervously and looks 
around the room. Suddenly he is attracted 
by something.

                         Close-up: Of tray of sandwiches on CONNELL's 
desk.

                         Close-up: Of TALL CHAP. He swallows 
hard. His eyes stare at the sandwiches 
hungrily.

                         Med. shot: Over his shoulder. Shooting 
toward the huddling group. It breaks 
up. They walk toward him.

                         Med. shot: Another angle.



                         What's your name?



                         Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John 
Willoughby they called me in baseball.




                         Er, would you, er, would you like to 
make some money?



                         Yeah, maybe.

                         NOTE: Henceforth in this script he shall 
be referred to as JOHN DOE.



                         Would you be willing to say you wrote 
that letterand stick by it?



                         Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.

                         There is an appraising pause, and CONNELL 
again signals them to join him in a 
huddle. They exit to their corner.




                         Close-up: Of JOHN. His eyes immediately 
go to the sandwiches.

                         Close-up: Of tray, with sandwiches and 
milk, on desk.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. His eyes riveted 
on tray. He glances, speculatively, 
over toward them and then back to the 
tray.

                         Med. shot: Of the huddled group.



                         That's our man. He's made to order.




                         I don't know. He don't seem like a guy 
that'd fall into line.



                         (it's significant to her)

                         When you're desperate for money, you 
do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's 
our man, I tell you.

                         Suddenly, they are startled by a loud 
thud: they all look around sharply.




                         He's fainted! Get some water quickly!


                         As all three rush to him.



                         Hurry up, Pop.



                         Oh.



                         (to John)

                         Right here. Sit down.



                         Huh?



                         Are you all right?



                         Yeah, I'm all right.

                         Dissolve to: Int. ANN's office. Close-up: 
Of JOHNsitting at ANN's desk, just 
completing a mealand still eating voraciously.


                         Camera draws back and we find another 
bindle-stiff sitting beside JOHN, packing 
food away in silence. He is the friend 
JOHN referred to. He is much older and 
goes by the name of COLONEL.

                         Camera continues to pull back revealing 
ANN who sits nearby, watching them sympathetically.


                         Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL. They 
continue eating. JOHN glances up and 
catches ANN's eye. He smiles self-consciously.


                         Close-up: Of ANN. She, too, smiles warmly.


                         Med. shot: They continue to eat silently.






                         How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, 
weren't you?



                         Say, all this John Doe business is batty, 
if yuh ask me.



                         Well, nobody asked yuh.



                         Trying to improve the world by jumping 
off buildings. You couldn't improve 
the world if the building jumped on 
you!



                         (to Ann)

                         Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.




                         He likes you well enough to stick around.




                         Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies.[6] 
I met him in a box car a couple o' years 
ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica 
and he comes over and joins in. I haven't 
been able to shake him since.

                         Full shot: Suddenly, he starts to play 
the overture from "William Tell." The 
COLONEL whips out an ocarina and joins 
him. ANN stares, amused. The door opens 
and CONNELL and BEANY barge in, followed 
by half a dozen photographers.



                         All right, boys, here he is.



                         (jumping up)

                         No, no, no! You can't take pictures 
of him like thateating a sandwichand 
with a beard!

                         She waves the photographers out, and 
shuts the door.



                         But, he's gonna jump off a building!




                         Yes, but not because he's out of a job. 
That's not news! This man's going to 
jump as a matter of principle.



                         Well, maybe you're right.



                         We'll clean him up and put him in a 
hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make 
a mystery out of him.

                         (suddenly)

                         Did you speak to Mr. Norton?





                         (nods)

                         Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to 
go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire 
under every big shot in the state.




                         Oh, swell! Is that the contract?

                         (seeing paper in CONNELL's hand)



                         Yes.

                         (sees the COLONEL)

                         What's he doing here?



                         Friend of his. They play duets together.




                         Duets? But can we trust him?



                         Oh!



                         I trust him.



                         Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's 
fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?




                         Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.




                         (insulted)

                         That's



                         Well, okay. But we don't want more than 
a couple o' hundred people in on this 
thing. Now the first thing I want is 
an exact copy of the John Doe letter 
in your own handwriting.



                         I got it all ready. Here.



                         Well, that's fine. Now I want you to 
sign this agreement. It gives us an 
exclusive story under your name day 
by day from now until Christmas. On 
December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad 
ticket out of town, and the Bulletin 
agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. 
That's what you want, isn't it?



                         Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone-Setter 
Brown.



                         Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, 
sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars 
for spending money. That's fine. Beany!






                         Yeah, Boss?



                         Take charge of him. Get him a suite 
at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.




                         Yeah, and some new clothes, Beany.




                         Do you think we better have him de-loused?




                         Yeh, yeh, yeh.



                         Both of 'em?



                         Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him 
out of your sight.



                         Hey, Beany, gray suit, huh?



                         Yeah.



                         Okay, fellows.



                         Take it easy, John Doe.

                         JOHN and the COLONEL follow BEANY out.




                         (turns to Ann)

                         And you! Start pounding that typewriter. 
Oh, boy! This is terrific! No responsibilities 
on our part. Just statements from John 
Doe and we can blast our heads off.




                         (interrupting)

                         Before you pop too many buttons, don't 
forget to make out that check for a 
thousand.



                         (grimaces)

                         Awwwww!

                         Dissolve to: Int. Living-room of suite.


                         Full shot: The door opens and BEANY 
enters. He is followed by JOHN and the 
COLONEL. JOHN glances around, impressed. 
The COLONEL looks glum.

                         Med. shot: At door. As JOHN exits scene 
into the room, tailed by the unhappy 
COLONEL. BEANY beckons someone out in 
the corridor.



                         Okay, fellas.



                         Three bruisers stand in the doorway.




                         Now, lemme see. You sit outside the 
door. Nobody comes in, see. You two 
fellas sit in here.

                         As they reach for chairs,

                         Cut to: Med. shot: JOHN is pleased as 
his gaze wanders around the room.




                         Hey, pretty nifty, huh?



                         You ain't gonna get me to stay here.




                         Sure, you are.



                         No, sir. That spot under the bridge 
where we slept last night's good enough 
for me.

                         While he speaks, JOHN has managed to 
get a glimpse of himself in a mirroradmiring 
his new suit.



                         Hey, what'll I do with this baggage?




                         Aw, stick 'em in the bedroom.



                         Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know 
we were headed for the Columbia River 
country before all this John Doe business 
came up. You remember that, don't yuh?




                         Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your 
ears pop coming up in the elevator? 
Mine did.



                         Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's 
no good. You're gonna get used to a 
lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. 
Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's 
beginning to show up on you already. 
And don't pull that on me neither!


                         (as John brings out harmonica)



                         Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get 
my arm fixed out of this.

                         Wider shot: As BEANY enters scene with 
box of cigars.



                         Here's some cigars the boss sent up. 
Have one.

                         JOHN's eyes light up.



                         Hey, cigars!



                         He grabs one and stuffs it in his mouth.




                         (to Colonel)

                         Help yourself.



                         Naw.

                         JOHN flops into a luxurious chairand 
immediately ANGELFACE holds a light 
up for his cigar. JOHN looks up, pleased.




                         Say, I'll bet yuh even the Major Leaguers 
don't rate an outfit like this.



                         (hands him a newspaper)

                         Here. Make yourself comfortable.

                         (turns to the Colonel)

                         Paper?



                         (sharply)

                         I don't read no papers and I don't listen 
to radios either. I know the world's 
been shaved by a drunken barber and 
I don't have to read it.

                         ANGELFACE backs away, puzzled.



                         (crosses to John)

                         I've seen guys like you go under before. 
Guys that never had a worry. Then they 
got ahold of some dough and went goofy. 
The first thing that happens to a guy




                         Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?




                         No.

                         BEANY beckons to him to follow, which 
JOHN does with great interest.

                         Int. bedroom: Full shot: As BEANY and 
JOHN puff luxuriously on their cigars 
and examine the room.



                         (in doorway)

                         The first thing that happens to a guy 
like thathe starts wantin' to go into 
restaurants and sit at a table and eat 
saladsand cup cakesand tea

                         (disgusted)

                         Boy, what that kinda food does to your 
system!

                         JOHN pushes on the bed and is impressed 
with its softness.



                         The next thing the dope wants is a room. 
Yessir, a room with steam heat! And 
curtains and rugs



                         and 'fore you know it, he's all softened 
up and he can't sleep 'less he has a 
bed.

                         Close-up: Of BEANY. He stares, bewildered, 
at the COLONEL.

                         Wider shot: JOHN turns and crosses to 
window.



                         (as he goes)

                         Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks 
ain't going to ruin me.



                         I seen plenty of fellers start out with 
fifty bucks and wind up with a bank 
account!



                         (can't stand it any more)

                         Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, 
anyway?



                         (ignoring him)

                         And let me tell you, Long John. When 
you become a guy with a bank account, 
they got you. Yessir, they got you!




                         Who's got him?



                         The heelots!



                         Who?



                         (at the window)

                         Hey. There's the City Hall tower I'm 
supposed to jump off of. It's even higher 
than this.



                         Who's got him?



                         The heelots!

                         Close-up: JOHN opens window and leans 
out.

                         Close-up: Of BEANY. His eyes pop; he's 
petrified.

                         Med. shot: JOHN stretches far out of 
the window, and quickly bounces back.




                         Wow!

                         At the same time BEANY springs to his 
side and yanks him back.



                         Hey, wait a minute! You ain't supposed 
to do that till Christmas Eve! Wanta 
get me in a jam?





                         (twinkle in his eye)

                         If it's gonna get you in a jam, I'll 
do you a favor. I won't jump.

                         He exits to the living room.

                         Int. living room: Full shot: As JOHN 
enters, flicking ashes from his cigar, 
grandly, the COLONEL leaves the doorway, 
still pursuing his point.



                         And when they get you, you got no more 
chance than a road-rabbit.



                         (dogging the COLONEL)

                         Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?




                         Say, is this one of those places where 
you ring if you want something?



                         Yeah. Just use the phone.

                         The thought of this delights JOHN.




                         Boy! I've always wanted to do this!


                         He goes to the phone.



                         Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that 
again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?




                         The heelots!



                         Who are they?

                         Two shot: The COLONEL finally levels 
off on BEANY.



                         Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?




                         Sure. Mostly often.



                         All right. You're walking alongnot 
a nickel in your jeansfree as the windnobody 
bothers youhundreds of people pass 
yuh by in every line of businessshoes, 
hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, 
everything. They're all nice, lovable 
people, and they let you alone. Is that 
right?

                         Close-up: Of BEANYnodding his head, 
bewildered.





                         Then you get hold of some dough, and 
what happens?

                         BEANY instinctively shakes his head.


                         Two shot: The COLONEL takes on a sneering 
expression.



                         All those nice, sweet, lovable people 
become heelots. A lotta heels.

                         (mysterioso)

                         They begin creeping up on youtrying 
to sell you something. They've got long 
claws and they get a strangle-hold on 
youand you squirmand duck and hollerand 
you try to push 'em awaybut you haven't 
got a chancethey've got you! First 
thing you know, you own things. A car, 
for instance.

                         BEANY has been following him, eyes blinking, 
mouth open.



                         Now your whole life is messed up with 
more stufflicense feesand number platesand 
gas and oiland taxes and insurance


                         Close shot: Of the LUGS at the door. 
One of them listens with a half-smile 
on his face. The other, more goofy, 
looks bewildered. He has been listeningand 
now, slowly rises, ears cocked, frightened 
by the harrowing tale. Camera retreats 
before himas he slowly walks nearer 
to BEANY and the COLONEL. Meantime, 
we continue to hear the COLONEL'S voice.




                          . . . and identification cardsand 
lettersand billsand flat tiresand 
dentsand traffic tickets and motorcycle 
cops and court roomsand lawyersand 
fines

behind BEANYand the two horrified faces 
are close togetherboth staring at the 
                         COLONEL.



                         And a million and one other things. 
And what happens? You're not the free 
and happy guy you used to be. You gotta 
have money to pay for all those thingsso 
you go after what the other feller's 
got

                         (with finality)

                         And there you areyou're a heelot yourself!


                         Close shot: Of the two heads of BEANY 
and the LUG. They continue to stare, 
wide-eyed, at the COLONEL.

                         Wider shot: As JOHN approaches the COLONEL.




                         (smiling)

                         You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. 
Go on out and get rid of it.





                         (as he goes)

                         You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna 
get some canned goodsa fishing rod, 
and the rest I'm gonna give away.




                         (aghast)

                         Give away?



                         (calling)

                         Hey. Get me a pitcher's glove! Got to 
get some practice.



                         Say, he's giving it away! I'm gonna 
get me some of that!



                         Hey, come back here, yuh heelot!



                         (on the phone)

                         Will you send up five hamburgers with 
all the trimmings, five chocolate ice 
cream sodas, and five pieces of apple 
pie? No, apple, with cheese. Yeah. Thank 
you.

                         JOHN hangs up.

                         The COLONEL has just reached the door 
when it flies open and Ann comes in 
with photographer EDDIEshe sees JOHN 
all dressed up.



                         Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't 
the man about town!



                         All set, Ann?



                         (coming out of it)

                         Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.

                         (she backs away)

                         Now, let's see. We want some action 
in these pictures.



                         Action?



                         Um-hum.

                         JOHN winds up in pitching posehis left 
leg lifted up high.



                         That's good.



                         No, no, no. This man's going to jump 
off a roof.



                         Oh.





                         Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your 
hair. Sit down. There. That's better.

of her hair and likes itwinks to the 
others. She poses JOHN's face and looks 
it over.



                         You know, he's got a nice face, hasn't 
he?



                         Yehhe's pretty.

                         JOHN gives him a look and starts to 
get up slowly.



                         Here. Sit down!

                         (to ANGELFACE)

                         Quiet, egghead!

                         (back to JOHN)

                         All right, now, a serious expression.




                         (laughing)

                         Can't. I'm feeling too good.



                         Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're 
a man disgusted with all of civilization.




                         With all of it?



                         Yes, you're sore at the world. Come 
on, now.



                         Oh, crabby guy, huh?

                         He tries scowling.



                         Yeah. No, no!

                         (laughing)

                         No! No, look. You don't have to smell 
the world!

                         (the men laugh)



                         Well, all those guys in the bleachers 
think



                         Never mind those guys. All right, stand 
up. Now let's see what you look like 
when you protest.



                         Against what?



                         Against anything. Just protest.



                         (laughing)

                         You got me.





                         Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just 
cut the heart of the plate with your 
fast one and I call it a ball. What 
would you do?



                         (advances toward her)

                         Oh, yuh did, huh?



                         Yes!



                         Why can't you call right, you bone-headed, 
pig-eared, lop-eared, pot-bellied




                         Grab it, Eddie, grab it!

                         Eddie takes the picture.

                         A Montage: Of Newspaper inserts featuring 
John Doe's picture.

                         "I protest against collapse of decency 
in the world."

                         "I protest against corruption in local 
politics."

                         "I protest against civic heads being 
in league with crime."

                         "I protest against state relief being 
used as political football."

                         "I protest against County Hospitals 
shutting out the needy."

                         "I protest against all the brutality 
and slaughter in the world."

                         Close-up: Superimposed over all of the 
above is a circulation chartshowing 
the circulation of the Bulletin in a 
constant rise.

                         Dissolve to: Int. GOVERNOR's study: 
Med. shot: The GOVERNOR paces furiously. 
In front of him are several associates.




                         I don't care whose picture they're publishing. 
I still say that this John Doe person 
is a myth. And you can quote me on that. 
And I'm going to insist on his being 
produced for questioning. You know as 
well as I do that this whole thing is 
being engineered by a vicious man with 
a vicious purposeMr. D. B. Norton.


                         As he finishes saying this, Dissolve 
to: Ext. D. B.'s estate:

                         Close-up: Of D. B. NORTON. Camera pulls 
back and we find him on horseback.


                         Reverse long shot: We discover that 
he is watching the maneuvers of a motorcycle 
corps who are in uniform. They are being 
drilled by TED SHELDON.



                         Med. shot: As a groom rides toward D. 
                         B.



                         Mr. Connell and Miss Mitchell are at 
the house, sir.



                         Oh, they are? All right, come on.

                         Dissolve to: Int. D. B. 's study: Med. 
shotpanning: As ANN, D. B. and CONNELL 
enter and cross to D. B. 's desk.




                         (as they walk)

                         Personally, I think it's just plain 
stupidity to drop it now.

                         They reach D. B. 's desk and stop.




                         You should see his fan mail! Thousands! 
Why, it's going over like a house afire!


                         Close-up: Of D. B. He studies her a 
moment before he turns to CONNELL.




                         What are you afraid of, Connell? It's 
doubled our circulation.

                         Wider shot: To include all three.



                         Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads 
are being pulledthe Governor's starting 
a libel suitwhat's more, they all know 
John Doe's a phoneyand they insist 
on seeing him.



                         Well, what about it? Let them see him! 
We'll go them one better. They can also 
hear him.

                         (to D. B.)

                         You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. 
Why not put him on the air?

                         Close-up: Of D. B. He admires her fight.




                         Watch out for this dame, D. B. She'll 
drive you batty!



                         Ohh!



                         Wider shot: To include all three.



                         Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league 
pitcher and start pumping him. Good 
night! No telling what that screwball 
might do. I walked in yesterdayhere 
he is, standing on a table with a fishing 
pole flycasting. Take my advice and 
get him out of town before this thing 
explodes in our faces!



                         If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as 
much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse 
me.



                         (to Annhotly)

                         No, you've got yourself a meal ticket 
and you hate to let go.



                         Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit 
it, but it's also a windfall for somebody 
like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash 
national politics.

                         (she turns to D. B.)

                         That's what you bought the newspaper 
for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta 
people, don't you? Well, put John Doe 
on the air and you can reach a hundred 
and fifty million of 'em. He can say 
anything he wants and they'll listen 
to him.

                         Close-up: Of D. B. Fascinated by ANN.


                         Wider shot: CONNELL stares at her derisively. 
D. B. is completely absorbed.



                         All right, let's not forget the Governor, 
the Mayor and all small fry like that. 
This can arouse national interest! If 
he made a hit around herehe can do 
it everywhere else in the country! And 
you'll be pulling the strings, Mr. Norton!


                         Close-up: Of D. B. His eyes have begun 
to light up with extensive plans.


                         Wider shot: D. B. continues to study 
ANN with deep interest. Then he turns 
to CONNELL.



                         Go down to the office and arrange for 
some radio time.



                         (protesting)

                         Why, D. B., you're not going to fall 
for



                         (interrupting sharply)

                         I want it as soon as possible.





                         (shrugging)

                         Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. 
Come on, let's go.

                         He starts out. ANN picks up her bag, 
prepared to follow CONNELL.



                         Er, don't you go. I want to talk to 
you.

                         CONNELL goes. ANN waits, somewhat nervously.




                         (when CONNELL is gone)

                         Sit down.

                         Med. two shot: ANN and D. B. D. B. studies 
her for a moment.



                          . . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, 
huh?



                         Yes, sir.



                         How much money do you get?



                         Thirty dollars.



                         (probingly)

                         Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you 
after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic 
career?



                         Money.



                         (laughs)

                         Money? Well, I'm glad to hear somebody 
admit it. Do you suppose you could write 
a radio speech that would put that fellow 
over?



                         Oh, I'm sure I can.



                         Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars 
a week.



                         A hundred dollars!



                         That's only the beginning. You play 
your cards right and you'll never have 
to worry about money again. Oh, I knew 
it.

                         ANN'S eyes brighten with excitement. 
They are interrupted by the arrival 
of TED SHELDON, in uniform.





                         (to TED)

                         Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman 
around, er

                         (laughing)

                         This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss 
Mitchell.



                         How do you do.



                         How do you do!



                         All right, Casanova. I'll give you a 
break. See that Miss Mitchell gets a 
car to take her home.



                         Always reading my mind, aren't you?




                         (laughing)

                         Thank you very much for everything.




                         And, Miss MitchellI think from now 
on you'd better work directly with me.




                         Yes, sir.

                         They exit. D. B. walks to the door, 
a pleased expression on his face.


                         Close-up: Of D. B. His face wreathed 
in a victorious smile.

                         Fade-out.

                         Fade-in: Int. ANN's living room: Close 
shot: Of ANN. She sits at a typewriter 
reading something she has written. Suddenly, 
impulsively, she yanks the sheet out 
of the machine and flings it to the 
floor. As she rises, camera pulls back. 
We find the floor littered with previously 
unsuccessful attempts to get the speech 
written. For a moment, ANN paces agitatedly, 
until she is interrupted by a commotion.


                         Med. Shot: At door. ANN's two sisters, 
IRENE and ELLEN, aged nine and elevenand 
dressed in their sleeping pajamas, dash 
in, squealing mischievously. Camera 
pans with them as they rush to ANN and 
leap on her.



                         Oh! Hey! Oh, hey! I thought you were 
asleep!



                         We just wanted to say good night, Sis.


                         They embrace and kiss her.



                         Oh, oh! Oh, you little brats! You're 
just stalling. I said good night!




                         Med. shot: At door. ANN'S MOTHER appears 
in the doorway. She is a prim little 
womanher clothes have a touch of the 
Victorian about themher hair is done 
up in old-fashioned style, her throat 
is modestly covered in lace.



                         (above the din)

                         Come, come, come, children. It's past 
your bedtime.



                         Oh, all right.



                         Go on!



                         Come on, Pooch! Come on, come on.



                         Now, keep Pooch off the bed.

                         The CHILDREN exit, squealing. ANN'S 
MOTHER goes to ANN's desk and searches 
for something.



                         Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll 
never get this speech right.



                         Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're 
very clever.



                         Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?




                         Your purse. I need ten dollars.



                         What for? I gave you fifty just the 
other day.



                         Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had 
her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And 
there wasn't a thing in the houseand 
then this morning the Community Chest[7] 
lady came around and



                         And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's 
the ten for?



                         The Websters.



                         The Websters!



                         You remember those lovely people your 
father used to take care of? I thought 
I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, 
dear, it's a shame, those poor





                         You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like 
Father used to be. Do you realize a 
couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough 
to eat ourselves?



                         Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people 
are in such need and we have plenty 
now.



                         If you're thinking of that thousand 
dollars, forget it. It's practically 
gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, 
you've just gotta stop giving all your 
money away.

                         Her MOTHER looks up, surprised at her 
tone.



                         Oh, Ann, dear!

                         Close-up: ANN realizes she has spoken 
sharply to her MOTHER and immediately 
regrets it. Her face softens.

                         Med. shot: As ANN crosses to her MOTHERand 
places an arm around her shoulder, tenderly.




                         Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any 
attention to me. I guess I'm just upset 
about all this. Gee whiz, here I am 
with a great opportunity to get somewhere, 
to give us security for once in our 
lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put 
this over, your Mrs. Burke can have 
six babies!



                         Do you mean the speech you're writing?




                         Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get 
it to jell! I created somebody who's 
gonna give up his life for a principle, 
hundreds of thousands of people are 
gonna listen to him over the radio and, 
unless he says something that's, well, 
that's sensational, it's just no good!




                         Well, honey, of course I don't know 
what kind of a speech you're trying 
to write, but judging from the samples 
I've read, I don't think anybody'll 
listen.



                         What?



                         Darling, there are so many complaining 
political speeches. People are tired 
of hearing nothing but doom and despair 
on the radio. If you're going to have 
him say anything, why don't you let 
him say something simple and real, something 
with hope in it? If your father were 
alive, he'd know what to say.





                         Oh, yes, Father certainly would.



                         Wait a minute . . .



                         Huh?

                         MRS. MITCHELL crosses to a desk, finds 
a key and unlocks a compartment. ANN 
watches her, curiously.

                         Close shot: MRS. MITCHELL extracts a 
diary from the compartment, which she 
handles very tenderly.

                         Camera pans with her as she goes back 
to ANN.



                         That's your father's diary, Ann.



                         Father's . . . I never knew he had a 
diary.



                         There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, 
things people ought to hear nowadays. 
You be careful of it, won't you dear? 
It's always helped keep your father 
alive for me.



                         (holds MOTHER's hand to her cheek)


                         You bet I will, Ma.

                         Her mother abruptly leaves.

                         Close-up: ANN turns her attention to 
the diary. As she opens it, her eyes 
sparkle expectantly. She becomes interested 
in the first thing she sees.

                         Dissolve to: Int. corridor of hotel.


                         Med. shot: At door of JOHN's suite. 
A crowd of people are around the door 
trying to crash it. The LUG on guard 
stands before the door.



                         Wait a minute. John Doe don't wanta 
sign no autographs.



                         Well, what does he do all day?



                         What does he do all day? He's writin' 
out his memories!

                         Cut to: Int. living room.

                         Med. shot: BEANY is on the telephone. 
He is apparently weary from answering 
them all day.





                         Sorry, lady. you can't see Mr. Doe. 
He wants to be alone. No, no, he just 
sits around all day and commutes with 
himself.

                         Camera swings around to JOHN. He stands 
in the middle of the floor, his pitcher's 
glove on, playing an imaginary game 
of ball. He winds up and throws an imaginary 
ball.

                         Close-up: Of the COLONEL. He wears a 
catcher's mittand smacks it as if he 
just caught the ball.



                         (umpiring)

                         Ba-ll!



                         I don't know how you're gonna stand 
it around here till after Christmas.


                         Full shot: At the door are the two LUGS, 
watching the imaginary ball game. The 
COLONEL takes a couple of steps over 
home plate, and throws the "ball" back 
to JOHN who picks it up out of the air.




                         (as he steps back behind the plate)


                         I betcha yuh ain't heard a train whistle 
in two weeks.

                         He crouches on his kneesand gives JOHN 
a signal.



                         St-rike!



                         I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're 
stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs 
is to get hooked up with a woman.


                         Close shot: Of JOHN. He shakes his head, 
and waits for another sign. When he 
gets it, he nods. He steps onto the 
moundwinds up and lets another one 
go. This is apparently a hit, for his 
eyes shoot skyward, and he quickly turnswatching 
the progress of the ball as it is flung 
to first base. From his frown we know 
the man is safe.

                         Close shot: Of the two LUGS, ANGELFACE 
and MIKE. ANGELFACE is seriously absorbed 
in the game. MIKE leans against the 
wall, eyes narrowed, a plan going on 
in his head.



                         (seriously)

                         What was that? A single?

                         Close-up: Of JOHN.



                         (explaining)

                         The first baseman dropped the ball.


                         Close-up: Of ANGELFACE.





                         (shouting at "firstbaseman")

                         Butterfingers!

                         (back to John)

                         That's tough luck, Pal.

                         Med. shot: JOHN disregards him completely. 
He is too much absorbed with the man 
on first. He now has the stance of a 
pitch without the windup.



                         When a guy has a woman on his handsthe 
first thing he knows his life is balled 
up with a lot more thingsfurniture 
and

"ball"gets into positionnods to his 
catcherraises his hands in the air, 
takes a peek toward first baseand suddenly 
wheels around facing camera, and whips 
the "ball" toward first base. Almost 
immediately his face lights up.

                         Close-up: Of ANGELFACE.



                         Did you get him?

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He winks.



                         (umpiring)

                         You're out!

                         Full shot: JOHN flips the glove off 
his hand so that it dangles from his 
wristand massages the ball with his 
two palms.



                         That's swell! What's thisthe end of 
the eighth?



                         Ninth!

                         He steps into the "pitcher's box".


                         Wider shot: Just as they take their 
positions, the LUG, from outside, partly 
opens the door.



                         Hey, Beany! There's a coupla lugs from 
the Chronicle snooping around out here!


                         BEANY immediately comes from background.




                         Come on, Angelface! Gangway!

                         As they reach the door, the LUG speaks 
to ANGELFACE.



                         What's the score, Angelface?



                         Three to twoour favor.





                         Gee, that's great!

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He has heard this 
and grins mischievously. He starts winding 
up for another pitch.

                         Close-up: Of MIKE. He looks around mischievously, 
then turns to JOHN.



                         You've got swell form. Must have been 
a pretty good pitcher.

                         Wider shot: JOHN is just receiving the 
ball.



                         Pretty good? Say, I was just about ready 
for the major leagues when I chipped 
a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' 
a nineteen-inning game!



                         Nineteen!



                         Yep. There was a major league scout 
there watching me, too. And he came 
down after the game with a contract. 
Do you know what? I couldn't life my 
arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again 
as soon as I get it fixed up.



                         (picks up newspapersighing)

                         That's too bad.



                         What do you mean, too bad?



                         (pretending distraction)

                         Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to 
play again.



                         Well, what are you talking about? I 
just told you I was gonna get a



                         (interrupting carelessly)

                         Well, you know how they are in baseballif 
a guy's mixed up in a racket



                         (walking over)

                         Racket? What do you mean?



                         Well, I was just thinking about this 
John Doe business. Why, as soon as it 
comes out it's all a fake, you'll be 
washed up in baseball, won't you?






                         Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought 
about that. Gosh!



                         And another thing, what about all the 
kids in the country, the kids that idolize 
ball players? What are they gonna think 
about you?

                         (shakes his head)

                         Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped 
his gloveflopped into a chairand has 
taken out his ocarina.



                         Hey, did you hear that, Colonel?

                         The COLONEL nods, disinterestedly, and 
begins to play.

                         Wider shot: JOHN ponders his dilemma 
for a second.



                         I gotta figure some way out of this 
thing!



                         The elevators are still runnin'.



                         (carelessly)

                         I know one way you can do it.



                         How?



                         Well, when you get up on the radio, 
all you have to do is say the whole 
thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero 
sure as you're born!

                         John thinks this over, but something 
troubles him.



                         Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm 
fixed?



                         Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody 
that'll give you five thousand dollars 
just to get up on the radio and tell 
the truth.



                         (eyes popping)

                         Five thousand dollars?



                         Yeah. Five thousand dollars. And he 
gets it right away. You don't have to 
wait till Christmas.



                         Look out, Long John! They're closing 
in on you!





                         (ignores COLONEL)

                         Say, who's putting up this dough?



                         Feller runs the Chronicle .

                         (takes it out of his pocket)

                         Here's the speech you makeand it's 
all written out for you.

                         JOHN takes it.

                         Five thousand dollars! Holy mackerel! 
I can see the heelots comin'. The whole 
army of them!



                         It's on the level.

                         Here he is.



                         Hello, John. All set for the big night? 
Swell!



                         Turn around.

                         Now, look, John. Here's the speech. 
It's in caps and double-spaced. You 
won't have any trouble reading it. Not 
nervous, are you?



                         No.



                         Of course not. He wouldn't be.



                         Who?



                         John Doe. The one in there.

                         (pointing to speech)



                         Hey, don't let your knees rattle. It 
picks up on the mike!



                         Oh, Beany! You needn't be nervous, John. 
All you have to remember is to be sincere.

                         Pick up the phone, Miss Mitchell. It's 
for you.

MRS. BREWSTER barges in, accompanied 
by two other ladies.



                         Oh, there he is, the poor, dear man! 
Oh, good luck to you, Mr. Doe. We want 
you to know that we're all for you. 
The girls all decided that you're not 
to jump off any roof a'tall. Oh, we'll 
stop it!

                         Have you got the speech I gave you?




                         (taps breast pocket)

                         Yeah.





                         Now, look. I'll give this money to the 
Colonel just as soon as you get started. 
We'll have a car waiting at the side 
entrance for you.



                         Okay.

                         Full shot: ANN turns away from the door.




                         (to MIKE)

                         How'd you get in here?



                         Huh? Oh, I just came in to wish him 
luck.



                         Come on, out. Out!

                         (turning to John)

                         Mother says good luck, too. John, when 
you read that speech, please, please 
believe every word of it. He's turned 
out to be a wonderful person, John.




                         Who?



                         John Doe, the one in the speech.



                         Oh. Yeah.



                         You know something? I've actually fallen 
in love with him.

                         Full shot: They are interrupted by the 
arrival of CONNELL. He is accompanied 
by several photographersand a beautiful 
girl in a bathing suit. A banner across 
her front reads: "Miss Average Girl".




                         All right, there he is, sister. Now, 
come onplenty of oomph!

                         The GIRL, all smiles, throws her arms 
around JOHN's shoulderand strikes a 
languid pose. The flashlights go off.




                         What's the idea?



                         No, no, no. Now that's too much!



                         One moment, please.



                         This is no time for cheap publicity, 
Mr. Connell!





                         Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want 
to get something out of it. I'm getting 
a Jane Doe ready!



                         (trying to get rid of them)

                         That's fine, honey. Now, get out!



                         All right. I need one more.



                         Go right ahead.

                         While there is this confusion, the COLONEL 
pushes in and stands in the doorway.




                         How're you doin'?



                         (calls to Beany outside)

                         All right, Beanybring 'em in!

                         While CONNELL speaks, two MIDGETS push 
the COLONEL out of the way and enter 
the room. The COLONEL glances downand 
nearly jumps out of his skin. BEANY 
follows them in.



                         Holy smoke! A half a heelot!



                         There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. 
Symbols of the little people.



                         Okay. Get them up.

                         BEANY lifts them and places them, one 
on each of JOHN's arms. The flashlights 
go off.



                         This is ridiculous, Mr. Connell! Come 
on, give him a chance. The man's on 
the air!

                         While she speaks, she tries to shove 
the photographers out.



                         (to girl midget)

                         Come on, Snooksyou better bail out.




                         (coquettishly)

                         Goodbye, Mr. Doe!

                         BEANY lifts her offand ANN pushes them 
all outjust as the STAGE MANAGER reappears.




                         Better get ready. One minute to go!




                         Two shot: JOHN and ANN. ANN turns quickly 
to JOHN.



                         Wow! One minute to go, and the score 
is nothing to nothing! Now, please, 
John, you won't let me down, will you? 
Will you? 'Course you won't. If you'll 
just think of yourself as the real John 
Doe.

                         Listen. Everything in that speech are 
things a certain man believed in. He 
was my father, John. And when he talked, 
people listened. They'll listen to you, 
too.

                         Funnyyou know what my mother said the 
other night? She said to look into your 
eyesthat I'd see Father there.



                         Heywhat do you say?



                         Okay! We're coming. Come on!



                         Now, listen, John. You're a pitcher. 
Now, get in there and pitch!

                         (kisses his cheek)

                         Good luck.

                         For a moment he just stares at her, 
under a spell. Then, turning, he exits. 
After a second of watching him, ANN 
follows.



                         Give him room, let him through. Come 
on.

                         Int. broadcasting stage: Med. shot: 
Camera retreats in front of JOHN and 
the official, as they leave the office 
and proceed to the microphones. Everyone 
stares curiously at JOHNwhispering 
to each other.

                         Med. shot: Shooting through glass partition, 
toward control booth. We see the two 
men at the board. They glance nervously 
at their watchesthen at the clock on 
the wall.

                         Close shot: Of ANN. She has taken a 
position at a table near the mike. Next 
to her sits CONNELL. ANN watches JOHN 
with intense interest.

                         The COLONEL has followed JOHN up to 
the microphone.



                         (to John)

                         Hey. Let's get out o' here. There's 
the door right there.



                         Hey, what're you doing here?



                         That's what I'd like to know!



                         Come on, out. Out.





                         Say, he's a friend of mine.



                         (at John's elbow)

                         Never mind. Let him alone. He's all 
right. I'll be right over there pulling 
for you.

                         JOHN starts to follow ANN away from 
mike. ANN leads him back to mike again.




                         No, Johnover here.



                         Stand by.

                         Med. shot: At door. The COLONEL surreptitiously 
tries the door, to see that it opens 
readily. Standing near him is BEANY 
and the others.

                         Med. shot: Group around SPENCER. They 
wait expectantly. Their eyes sparkling 
with excitement.



                         Phone the Chronicle . Tell 'em to start 
getting those extras out.

                         Med. shot: Toward control booth. The 
man with the earphones on has his hand 
up ready to give the signal. He listens 
a moment, then abruptly drops his hand.


                         Close-up: The man near the announcer 
throws his hand up as a signal to someone 
off scene.

                         Med. shot: An orchestra in a corner. 
The conductor waves his batonand the 
orchestra blasts out a dramatic fanfare.


                         Close shot: ANNOUNCER and JOHN. ANNOUNCER 
holds his script up and the moment the 
music stops he speaks dramatically.




                         (rapid-fire)

                         And good evening, ladies and gentlemen. 
This is Kenneth Frye, speaking for the 
New Bulletin . Tonight we give you something 
entirely new and different. Standing 
beside me is the young man who has declared 
publicly that on Christmas Eve he intends 
to commit suicide, giving as his reasonquote: 
"I protest against the state of civilization." 
End quote. Ladies and gentlemen, the 
New Bulletin takes pleasure in presenting 
the man who is fast becoming the most 
talked-of person in the whole country, 
                         JOHN DOE!

                         The man next to him waves his handthere 
is an outburst of music.

                         A flash: Of ANNshe looks at JOHN intently.


                         Med. shot: Group around BEANY. They 
all applaud, except for MIKE and the 
COLONEL. MIKE, with his hand hanging 
down, nudges the COLONEL.



                         Close shot: Of their hands meeting and 
we see the envelope change hands. Camera 
pans up to the COLONEL's face which 
is twisted into a miserable grimace.


                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He glances around, 
uncertainly.

                         Close shot: Of MIKE and the COLONEL. 
MIKE elbows the COLONEL to throw his 
signal. The COLONEL looks toward JOHN 
and nods his head.

                         Close shot: Of JOHN. He catches the 
COLONEL'S signal and quickly his hand 
goes to his pocket. Just as he is about 
to bring it out, his hand pauses. He 
turns and looks at ANN.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. A warm, pleading look 
in her eyes.

                         Med. shot: Around JOHN. He is still 
staring at ANN, when the ANNOUNCER reaches 
over and nudges himpointing to the 
mike. JOHN snaps out of itturns his 
face to the mikepushes the paper back 
in his pocketand starts reading ANN'S 
speech.



                         (reading speech)

                         Ladies and gentlemen: I am the man you 
all know as John Doe.

                         (clearing his throat)

                         I took that name because it seems to 
describebecause it seems to describe


                         (his voice unnatural)

                         the average man, and that's me.

                         (repeats, embarrassedly)

                         And that's me.

                         Med. shot: The COLONEL and MIKE. The 
COLONEL realizes JOHN is not going to 
make SPENCER'S speech, and his face 
breaks into a broad grin. He takes MIKE'S 
hand and slaps the envelope into his 
palm. Over the shot we hear JOHN'S voice.




                         Well, it was mebefore I said I was 
gonna jump off the City Hall roof at 
midnight on Christmas Eve. Now, I guess 
I'm not average any more. Now, I'm getting 
all sorts of attention, from big shots, 
too.

                         Med. shot: To include JOHN and ANN.


                         Med. shot: Around SPENCER, as MIKE enters 
to him and hands him envelope.



                         (whispering)

                         We've been double-crossed!

                         SPENCER stares at the envelope, frothing 
at the mouth.



                         We have!?



                         Med. shot: Featuring JOHN and ANN.




                         The Mayor and the Governor, for instance. 
They don't like those articles I've 
been writing.

                         Suddenly they are startled by SPENCER's 
voice.



                         You're an imposter, young fella! That's 
a pack of lies you're telling!

                         Quick flashes: Of reaction from audience, 
CONNELL and others.



                         Who wrote that speech for you?

                         (pointing accusing finger at JOHN)




                         Beany, get that guy!

                         Med. shot: Around SPENCER. It is as 
far as he gets. Several attendants, 
BEANY among them, have reached him and 
start throwing him out.

                         Cut to: Int. D. B. NORTON's study: Med. 
shot: D. B. and TED SHELDON are listening 
to JOHN's speech over the radio. D. 
B. is astonished at the disturbance 
in the program.



                         (recognizing the voice)

                         That's Spencer!

                         Cut to: Int. broadcasting stage:

                         Close shot: Of ANNOUNCER.



                         Ladies and gentlemen, the disturbance 
you just heard was caused by someone 
in the audience who tried to heckle 
Mr. Doe. The speech will continue.


                         Med. shot: Featuring JOHN and ANN.




                         Well, people like the Governor

                         (laughingad libs)

                         People like the Governor and that fella 
there cancan stop worrying. I'm not 
gonna talk about them.

                         ANN smiles admiringly.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He is becoming strangely 
absorbed in what he is saying.





                         I'm gonna talk about us, the average 
guys, the John Does. If anybody should 
ask you what the average John Doe is 
like, you couldn't tell him because 
he's a million and one things. He's 
Mr. Big and Mr. Small. He's simple and 
he's wise. He's inherently honest, but 
he's got a streak of larceny in his 
heart. He seldom walks up to a public 
telephone without shoving his finger 
into the slot to see if somebody left 
a nickel there.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. Her eyes are glued 
on JOHN.



                         He's the man the ads are written for. 
He's the fella everybody sells things 
to. He's Joe Doakes,[8] the world's 
greatest stooge and the world's greatest 
strength.

                         (clearing throat)

                         Yes, sir. Yessir, we're a great family, 
the John Does. We're the meek who are, 
er, supposed to inherit the earth. You'll 
find us everywhere. We raise the crops, 
we dig the mines, work the factories, 
keep the books, fly the planes and drive 
the busses! And when a cop yells: "Stand 
back there, you!" He means us, the John 
Does!

                         Cut to: Int. D. B. 's study:

                         Med. shot: D. B. and TED listen near 
the radio. TED's eyes flash angrily.




                         Well, what kind of a speech is that? 
Didn't you read it?

                         D. B. stops him with a gesture of his 
hand. He doesn't want to miss a word.


                         Cut to: Int. broadcasting stage:

                         Med. shot: Toward JOHN.



                         We've existed since time began. We built 
the pyramids, we saw Christ crucified, 
pulled the oars for Roman emperors, 
sailed the boats for Columbus, retreated 
from Moscow with Napoleon and froze 
with Washington at Valley Forge!

                         (gasping)

                         Yes, sir. We've been in there dodging 
left hooks since before history began 
to walk! In our struggle for freedom 
we've hit the canvas many a time, but 
we always bounced back!

                         Med. shotpanning: Around audienceto 
get a variety of interested faces.




                         Because we're the people and we're 
tough!

                         Close-up: Of JOHN.





                         They've started a lot of talk about 
free people going softthat we can't 
take it. That's a lot of hooey! . . 
. A free people can beat the world at 
anything, from war to tiddle-de-winks, 
if we all pull in the same direction!


                         Med. shot: To include radio announcer 
and other radio officials. Their interest 
centers on JOHN.



                         I know a lot of you are saying "What 
can I do? I'm just a little punk. I 
don't count." Well, you're dead wrong! 
The little punks have always counted 
because in the long run the character 
of a country is the sum total of the 
character of its little punks.

                         Int. D. B.'s study. Med. Shot. D. B.'s 
expression of disturbance has vanished. 
It is now replaced by one of thoughtfulness 
and interest. He looks off toward the 
foyer, and impulsively goes in that 
direction.

                         Cut to:

                         Int. foyer.

                         Med. shot: D. B. crosses to a pantry 
door and pushes the swinging door open 
slightly.

                         Int. pantry: Med. shot: All we can see 
through the slightly open door is one 
side of the room. Clustered around the 
radio on a table are all the household 
help. They listen, fascinated.

                         Int. foyer: Closeup of D. B. His eyes 
begin to brighten with an idea. Meantime, 
over the foregoing shots, JOHN's voice 
has continued.



                         But we've all got to get in there and 
pitch! We can't win the old ball game 
unless we have team work. And that's 
where every John Doe comes in! It's 
up to him to get together with his teammate!


                         Cut to: Int. broadcasting station:


                         Med. shot: Closeup: Of JOHN.



                         And your teammates, my friends, is the 
guy next door to you. Your neighbor! 
He's a terribly important guy, that 
guy next door! You're gonna need him 
and he's gonna need you . . . so look 
him up! If he's sick, call on him! If 
he's hungry, feed him! If he's out of 
a job, find him one! To most of you, 
your neighbor is a stranger, a guy with 
a barking dog, and a high fence around 
him.

                         Med. shot: Somewhere in audience.





                         Now, you can't be a stranger to any 
guy that's on your own team. So tear 
down the fence that separates you, tear 
down the fence and you'll tear down 
a lot of hates and prejudices! Tear 
down all the fences in the country and 
you'll really have teamwork!

                         Med. shot: Around BEANY and the LUGS. 
They, too, are interested.



                         I know a lot of you are saying to yourselves: 
"He's asking for a miracle to happen. 
He's expecting people to change all 
of a sudden." Well, you're wrong. It's 
no miracle. It's no miracle because 
I see it happen once every year. And 
so do you. At Christmas time! There's 
something swell about the spirit of 
Christmas, to see what it does to people, 
all kinds of people . . .

                         Close-up: Of ANN. Her eyes go from JOHN 
to the audienceas she watches their 
reaction.

                         Full shot: Shooting toward audience 
over JOHN's shoulder.



                         Now, why can't that spirit, that same 
warm Christmas spirit last the whole 
year round? Gosh, if it ever did, if 
each and every John Doe would make that 
spirit last three hundred and sixty-five 
days out of the year, we'd develop such 
a strength, we'd create such a tidal 
wave of good will, that no human force 
could stand against it.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He has become visibly 
affected by the speech himself.



                         Yes, sir, my friends, the meek can only 
inherit the earth when the John Does 
start loving their neighbors. You'd 
better start right now. Don't wait till 
the game is called on account of darkness! 
Wake up, John Doe! You're the hope of 
the world!

                         He has finishedbut does not move. He 
drops his head to conceal the moisture 
in his eyes.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. She, too, remains 
seated. Her moist eyes riveted on JOHN.


                         Med. long shot: Of Audience. There is 
no outburst of applause. All continue 
to stare forward, emotionally touched.


                         Med. shot: Of ANN. She runs over to 
John.



                         John! You were wonderful!

                         Med. shot: Of the audience. They too 
realize it is overand gradually they 
rise and applaud him wildly, and the 
radio station rings with cheers.



                         Med. shot: JOHN and ANN. JOHN stares 
at ANN, then turns to COLONEL.



                         (as he reaches COLONEL)

                         Let's get out of here.

                         They exit through the door at which 
the COLONEL has been on guard.



                         Now you're talking!

                         Med. shot: At side door. The COLONEL 
opens it, and a little crowd of autograph 
hounds wait for JOHN.



                         Gangway, you heelots!

                         They push their way to a taxi waiting 
at the curb.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. She stares at them 
leaving, follows and tries to stop them, 
but her efforts are unsuccessful.

shot: JOHN and the COLONEL are in a 
secluded spot. The lights of the city 
can be seen in the distance. The COLONEL 
is building a fire.



                         I knew you'd wake up sooner or later! 
Boy, am I glad we got out of that mess.


                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He reaches around 
and pulls his pitcher's glove out of 
his back pocket, and starts pounding 
his fist into it.



                         I had that five thousand bucks sewed 
up! Could have been on my way to old 
Doc Brown!

                         (imitates Ann)

                         "You're a pitcher, John," she said, 
"Now go in there and pitch!

                         (self-beratingly)

                         What a sucker!

                         Wider shot: To include the COLONEL, 
who has quite a mound of twigs built, 
under which he lights a match.



                         Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest 
of them. It's lucky you got away from 
her.



                         What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, 
anyway? Me? Huh? Gee, the more I think 
about it the more I could . . .



                         Tear down all the fences. Why, if you 
tore one picket off of your neighbor's 
fence he'd sue you!



                         Five thousand bucks! I had it right 
in my hand!

                         Four bits.



                         Better make it doughnuts, huh?

On its side is a sign reading "JOIN

the coffee urn. From back of it he has 
taken a local paperon the front page 
of which is JOHN's picture. The WAITER 
looks at it and then turns his head 
to JOHN.

turn and see the waiter watching them 
peculiarly.

                         Oh!



                         Long John Willoughby.

                         I'm a baseball player.



                         Sure.



                         (eyes brightening)

                         Oh, no. I'd know that voice anywhere. 
You can't kid me! You're John Doe! Hey, 
Ma! Ma! That's John Doe!



                         John Doe?



                         Yeah. Sitting right there, big as life.




                         Who'd you say it was?



                         John Doe! The big guy there! Picture's 
in the paper!

                         JOHN gives the COLONEL the office and 
they hastily exit. Several customers, 
who had gathered around, now evince 
interest. DAN identifies JOHN as JOHN 
DOE, and the people follow JOHN out 
into the street. DAN hastily seizes 
the phone.



                         Hey, Operator? Dan's Beanery. Look. 
Call everybody in town. John Doe was 
just in my place. Yeh. He ordered doughnuts.


                         Long shot: Shooting out of window toward 
street. We see JOHN and the COLONEL 
as they hurry away, being followed by 
the crowd which is gradually growing 
larger . . . as we see people crossing 
the street to get to them



                         There he is!

                         John Doe!

                         There he is! Come on!

                         Gotta see John Doe!

Millville City Hall. The sidewalk is 
crowded with people. Those near the 
entrance are trying to force their way 
in. MAYOR HAWKINS guards the door.




                         I know, you all voted for me and you're 
all anxious to see John Doe. We're all 
neighbors, but my office is packed like 
a sardine box.



                         What does John Doe look like, Mr. Mayor.




                         Oh, he's one of those great big outdoor 
type of men. No, you can't see him.


                         MAYOR notices one member of the crowd 
particularly.



                         You didn't vote for me the last time. 
Shame on youget off my front porch!


                         (turning)

                         Mr. Norton come yet? What's keeping 
him? He should of been here fifteen 
minutes ago. Oh, there he comes now. 
Now, everybody on your dignity. Don't 
do anything to disgrace us. This is 
a little town, but we gotta show off.




                         Wider shot: Of curb. From off-scene 
we hear the wail of sirens, and as the 
crowd on the sidewalk turn they see 
two motorcycle cops drive in, followed 
by a limousine.

                         Better let me talk to him.



                         All right, but present it to him as 
a great cause for the common man.


                         ANN nods as they start toward building. 
Camera pans with them as the cops break 
through the curious mob.

assist them.

there! Give him room, folks! How do 
you do, Mr. Norton! I'm the Mayor

                         Let me go, you dern fool! I'm the Mayor! 
Mr. Norton! I'm Mayor Hawkins. Your 
office telephoned me to hold him.

                         Oh, he's fine. He's right in my office 
there. You know, this is a great honor 
having John Doe here, and you too. Haven't 
had so much excitement since the old 
city hall burned down.

                         (chuckling)

                         People were so excited, they nearly 
tore his clothes off.

Tell them Mr. Norton is here. Step right 
inside, Mr. Nortonmy office is very 
comfortable here, Mr. Norton. Just had 
it air-conditioned. Gangway, please. 
Make room for Mr. Norton. Gangway, gangway. 
Here he is, Mr. Norton, well taken care 
of. The neighbors are serving him a 
light lunch.

and the COLONEL are surrounded by a 
room full of people, including the SHERIFF 
in full uniform and several policemen. 
JOHN sits at the MAYOR'S desk, which 
is filled with edibles. D.B., ANN and 
the MAYOR enter. JOHN, upon seeing ANN, 
gets to his feet.





                         Hello, John.



                         Hello.



                         Mister Mayor, if you don't mind, we'd 
like to talk to him alone.



                         Why, certainly, certainly. All right, 
everybody, clear out.

                         They all start to shuffle outthe MAYOR 
excitedly egging them on.



                         Quit pushing.



                         Don't argue with me here. Wait till 
we get home.



                         Don't you push me around like that! 
Even though I'm your wife, you can't 
push me around



                         Ohhhh!

                         They all shuffle out, and D.B. shuts 
the door. JOHN watches him, doesn't 
like his proprietary manner.



                         Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got 
a lot of nerve having those people hold 
us here.



                         There's nobody holding you here, Mr. 
Doe.

                         (laughing)

                         It's only natural that people



                         Well, if there's nobody holding us here, 
let's get going. Incidentally, my name 
isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.



                         (gets in front of himpleads)

                         Look, John. Something terribly important's 
happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. 
We know of eight already and they say 
that there's going



                         (interested despite himself)

                         John Doe Clubs? What for?



                         Uh-huh. To carry out the principles 
you talked about in your radio speech.






                         (regains his former attitude)

                         I don't care what they're forming. I'm 
on my way and I don't like the idea 
of being stopped either.



                         Oh, but you don't know how big this 
thing is. You should see the thousands 
of telegrams we've received and what 
they're saying about you.



                         Look, it started as a circulation stunt, 
didn't it?



                         Uh-huh . . .



                         Well, you got your circulation. Now, 
why don't you let me alone?



                         Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, 
but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants 
to get back of it and sponsor John Doe 
Clubs all over the country. He wants 
to send you on a lecture tour.



                         Me?



                         Uh-huh.



                         Why, certainly. With your ability to 
influence people, it might grow into 
a glorious movement.



                         Say, let's get something straight here. 
I don't want any part of this thing. 
If you've got an idea I'm going around 
lecturing to people, why you're crazy! 
Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking 
to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out 
of here.



                         John!

                         The beaming COLONEL starts to follow 
him to the door. When they get there, 
the door suddenly flies open and a crowd 
of townspeople push their way inwith 
the MAYOR and the SHERIFF trying to 
hold them back.



                         Please, please! I just got rid of one 
crowd.



                         Oh, but please. Mr. Mayor, tell him 
the John Doe Club wants to talk to him.


                         Close-up: Of D. B. He gets an idea. 
These people might influence JOHN.






                         Let them in, Mr. Mayor. Let them come 
in.

                         Full shot: As the MAYOR and the SHERIFF 
back away.



                         Okay, folks, but remember your manners. 
No stampeding. Walk slow, like you do 
when you come to pay your taxes.

                         Med. shot: Of the group. They shuffle 
forward grinning happily. Those in the 
rear rise on tiptoes for a better look. 
The men doff their hats as they come 
forward.

                         Med. shot: Of JOHN, the COLONEL, ANN 
and D.B. John glances around nervously. 
The COLONEL is worried.

                         Med. shot: Of the townspeople. They 
just stand there, awkwardly, some grinning 
sheepishly, others staring at JOHN. 
Finally someone nudges a young man in 
the foreground and whispers.



                         Come on, Bert.



                         Okay. All right, give me a chance.




                         (making room for him)

                         Come right in.

wait expectantly.

his story.



                         Well, sir, you see, me and my wife, 
we heard your broadcast, and we got 
quite a bang out of it, especially my 
wife.

                         Wider shot: To include JOHN and the 
others.



                         Kept me up half the night saying "That 
man's right, honey. The trouble with 
the world isnobody gives a hoot about 
his neighbor. That's why everybody in 
town's sore and cranky at each other."


                         And I kept saying, "Well, that's fine, 
but how's a guy gonna go around loving 
the kind of neighbors we got? Old Sourpuss 
for instance!"

                         (laughing)

                         You see, Sourpuss Smithers is a guy 
who lives all alone next door to us. 
He's a cranky old man and runs a second-hand 
furniture store. We haven't spoken to 
him for years. I always figured he was 
an ornery old gent that hated the world 
cause he was always slamming his garage 
door and playing the radio so loud he 
kept half the neighbors up.

                         (laughing)



                         Close-up: Of BERT.



                         Well, anyway, the next morning I'm out 
watering the lawn and I look over and 
there's Sourpuss on the other side of 
the hedge straightening out a dent in 
his fender and, er, my wife yells to 
me out of the window. She says, "Go 
on. Speak to him, Bert." And I figured, 
well, heck, I can't lose anythingso 
I yelled over to him "Good morning, 
Mr. Smithers." He went right on pounding 
his fender, and was I burned! So I turned 
around to give my wife a dirty look 
and she said, "Louder, louder. He didn't 
hear you." So, in a voice you could 
of heard in the next county, I yelled. 
"Good morning, Mr. Smithers!"

                         Med. shot: Featuring JOHN and BERT. 
JOHN is very interested.



                         Well, sir, you coulda knocked me over 
with a feather. Old Sourpuss turned 
around surprised like, and he put on 
a big smile, came over and took my hand 
like an old lodge brother, and he said. 
"Good morning, Hansen. I've been wanting 
to talk to you for years, only I thought 
you didn't like me." And then he started 
chatting away like a happy little kid, 
and he got so excited his eyes begin 
waterin' up.

                         Med. shot: Of a group of neighbors. 
They smile sympathetically.



                         Well, Mr. Doe, before we got through, 
I found out Smithers is a swell egg, 
only he's pretty deaf, and that accounts 
for all the noises.

                         Wider shot: To include BERT, JOHN and 
others.



                         And he says it's a shame how little 
we know about our neighbors, and then 
he got an idea, and he said, "How's 
about inviting everybody some place 
where we can all get together and know 
each other a little better?" Well, I'm 
feeling so good by this time, I'm ripe 
for anything.

                         Close shot: Of ANN and D. B. They listen, 
amused and excited.



                         So Smithers goes around the neighborhood 
inviting everybody to a meeting at the 
school house and I tell everybody that 
comes in the store, including Mr. Schwabacher, 
my boss.

                         (laughing)

                         Oh, I'm talking too much.

                         Med. shot: JOHN and BERT.





                         Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty 
people don't show up. 'Course none of 
us knew what to do, but we sure got 
a kick out of seeing how glad everybody 
was just to say hello to one another.




                         Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, 
honey.



                         Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman 
and decided to call ourselves The John 
Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this 
is my wife. Come here, honey.

                         His WIFE comes forward and stands beside 
him.



                         This is my wife, Mr. Doe.

                         MRS. HANSEN nods her head shylyand 
JOHN acknowledges the introduction by 
a half wave of his hand.



                         How do you do, Mr. Doe . . . Er, Sourpuss 
is here, too.



                         (turns around)

                         Oh, is he?



                         (pointing)

                         Uh-huh.

                         Med. shot: Of a group around SOURPUSS. 
He is as described, except when he smiles, 
his whole face warms up. Those around 
him push him forward. At first he looks 
bewildered, then, understanding, he 
starts toward BERT, grinning sheepishly.


                         Med. shot: Around BERTas SOURPUSS comes 
forward.



                         This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, 
Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.



                         Ththat's all right. If you didn't call 
me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.


                         (laughing)

                         There are snickers from the background.




                         Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody 
in the neighborhood came, except the 
DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big 
house with an iron fence around it and 
they always keep their blinds drawn, 
and we always figured that he was just 
an old miser that sat back counting 
his money, so why bother about inviting 
him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke 
up and he said, "Say, you've got the 
Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells




                         us about how they cancelled their milk 
last week, and how, when he found a 
note in the bottle he got kinda curious 
like and he sorta peeked in under the 
blinds and found the house empty. "If 
you ask me," he says, "they're starving."




                         Old man Delaney has been bringing his 
furniture over to my place at night, 
one piece at a time, and selling it.


                         Close shot: Of JOHN. Profoundly impressed 
by this.

                         Wider shot: BERT clears his throat.




                         Yeah. And, well, sir, a half a dozen 
of us ran over there to fetch them and 
we got them to the meeting. What a reception 
they got. Why, everybody shook hands 
with them and made a fuss over them, 
and, well, finally, Mr. and Mrs. Delaney 
just sat right down and cried.

                         He smiles, embarrassed, and JOHN, as 
well as the others, clear their throats.




                         And then we started to find out about 
a lot of other people.



                         Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for 
instance.



                         Grubbel's here. See?

                         (pointing)



                         Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, 
you don't know Grubbel, but he's the 
man that everybody figured was the worst 
no-account in the neighborhood because 
he was living like a hermit and nobody'd 
have anything to do with him. Er, that 
is until Murphy, the postman told us 
the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, 
"he lives out of garbage cans because 
he won't take charity. Because it'd 
ruin his self-respect," he says.



                         Just like you said on the radio, Mr. 
Doe.



                         Well, sir, about a dozen families got 
together and gave Grubbel a job watering 
their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And 
then we found jobs for six other people 
and they've all gone off relief!



                         Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker 
made a job in his warehouse for old 
man Delaney





                         And he gave you that five dollar raise.




                         Yeah! Wasn't that swell!

                         (laughing)

                         Med. shot: Around MAYOR HAWKINS. He 
steps forward.



                         Why, Bert, I feel slighted. I'd like 
to join but nobody asked me.

                         Med. shot: Around BERT and SOURPUSS.




                         Well, I'm sorry, Mayor, but we voted 
that no politicians could join.



                         Just the John Does of the neighborhood. 
Cause you know how politicians are.


                         (becomes embarrassed)

                         Close-up: Of the MAYORcompletely deflated.




                         Yeah . . .

                         Med. shot: Around JOHN. As they smile, 
amused at the MAYOR'S discomfiture.


                         Med. shot: Around BERT. He looks over 
at JOHN, hesitates a moment, and then 
speaks.



                         Well, er, the reason we wanted to tell 
you this, Mr. Doe, was to give you an 
idea what you started. And from where 
I'm sitting, I don't see any sense in 
your jumping off any building.



                         No!



                         No!



                         Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, 
Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and 
it strikes me you can be mighty useful 
walking around for a while.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. Deeply touched. Shifts 
awkwardly, unable to say anything.


                         Med. shot: As D. B. and ANN watch his 
face to see the effect.



                         Well, goodbye.



                         Goodbye Mr. Doe.



                         BERT has turned to go, and the rest 
follow suit. They all shuffle silently 
out.

                         Med. shot: Of an old couple who remain 
looking up at JOHN, as those around 
them leave. The old lady takes the old 
man's arm and starts toward JOHN. Camera 
pans with them until they reach him.




                         I'm Mrs. Delaney, Mr. Doe . . . and 
God bless you, my boy.

                         (she gently kisses his hand)

                         The two OLD PEOPLE leave.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He swallows a lump 
in his throat. He watches the old people 
until they have left, then with a quick 
glance at his handand self-consciously 
in front of the others, stuffs his hand 
into his pocket.

                         Full shot: As they all watch him, without 
speaking. JOHN runs his hand through 
his hair, stealing a fleeting glance 
at the others, and grins awkwardly.


                         Close shot: Of D. B. as he signals to 
the MAYOR and the SHERIFF, who have 
remained, to leave.

                         Med. shot: Of the MAYOR and the SHERIFF, 
who receive the signal and discreetly 
exit.

                         Full shot: They wait for JOHN to speak, 
but JOHN begins walking around, profoundly 
thoughtful.

                         Close-up: Of the COLONEL watching him, 
concerned.

                         Two shot: Of D. B. and ANN. Their eyes 
glued on him, expectantly.

                         Full shot: JOHN still paces, disturbed 
by clashing emotions. He stops, glances 
at the door, a soft, thoughtful expression 
in his eyes. Then, as his thought shifts, 
he runs his left hand over his pitching 
arm.



                         Gee, whizI'm all mixed upI don't get 
it. Look, all those swell people think 
I'm gonna jump off a building or something.


                         He looks toward the door.



                         I never had any such idea. Gosh! A fella'd 
have to be a mighty fine example himself 
to go around telling other people how 
toSay, look, what happened the other 
night was on account of Miss Mitchell, 
here. She wrote the stuff.

                         ANN walks over to JOHN.

                         Two shot: ANN and JOHN. She faces him, 
looking up into his face.





                         Don't you see what a wonderful thing 
this can be?

                         (softly)

                         But we need you , John.

                         Close-up: Of the COLONEL. He stares 
at JOHN, sees him weakening, and grimaces 
disgustedly.

                         Wider shot: The COLONEL watches JOHN 
as he continues to turn it over in his 
mind.



                         (suddenly)

                         You're hooked! I can see that right 
now.

                         They all look up, startled.



                         They got you. Well, I'm through.

                         (crosses to doorstops, turns)

                         For three years I've been trying to 
get you up to the Columbia River country. 
First, it was your glass arm. Then it 
was the radio. And now it's the John 
Doe clubs. Well, I ain't waiting another 
minute.

                         He opens the door and when he sees the 
townspeople still gathered outside, 
he yells to them.



                         Gangway, you heelots!

                         He pushes his way out.



                         (calling)

                         Hey, Colonel! Wait a minute!

                         He starts after the COLONEL, but when 
he gets to the door, the townspeople 
surge toward him and block his way.




                         Hey, Colonel!



                         Oh, please, Mr. Doe

                         Close-up: Of JOHN.



                         (calling futilely)

                         Hey, Colonel!

                         He tries to peer over the heads of the 
townspeople who go on chattering. There 
is a trapped look on JOHN's face.


                         Two shot: D. B. and ANN. They exchange 
victorious glances:

                         Dissolve to: Int. office of headquarters. 
Close shot: Of large map of the U.S. 
over the top of which we read: "John 
Doe Clubs." There are a dozen pegs scattered 
over the map, indicating where the clubs 
are. We hear D. B.'s voice.

                         Camera draws back and we find D. B. 
talking to a group of men in front of 
him.





                         I want you personally to go along with 
John Doe and Miss Mitchell and handle 
the press and the radio.



                         (an experienced promoter)

                         Me?



                         Yes. I don't want to take any chances. 
And Johnson?



                         Yes. D. B.



                         Your crew will do the mop up job. They'll 
follow John Doe into every town, see 
that the clubs are properly organized 
and the charters issued.



                         Right.



                         There are only eight flags up there 
now. I want to see that map covered 
before we get through!

                         Med. shot: D. B. is still speaking as 
camera moves down to the map again, 
which constantly remains a background 
for the montage following. As the montage 
proceeds, pegs begin to appear in abundance 
on the map.

                         A montage: Accompanied by a fanfare 
of music.

every state in the union have pegs in

On the other side of D. B. is TED SHELDON.




                         I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, this 
thing has been nothing short of a prairie 
fire. We've received so many applications 
for charters to the John Doe Clubs we 
haven't been able to take care of them.




                         I'd hate to have that many pins stuck 
in me!

                         Group laughs.



                         This John Doe convention is a natural. 
It's gonna put our city on the map. 
Why, over twentyfour hundred John Doe 
clubs are sending delegates. Can you 
imagine that? You, Mr. Mayor, will be 
the official host. You will make the 
arrangements for decorating the city, 
parades and a reception for John Doe 
when he gets home! Anddon't wear your 
high hat!





                         (disappointed)

                         No high hat?



                         No high hat. And from you, Connell, 
I want a special John Doe edition every 
day until the convention is over.


                         (dismissing them)

                         And now, if you will please just step 
into the outer office and look your 
prettiest because there are photographers 
there to take pictures of this committee.


                         They start to exit. The MAYOR is full 
of excitement.



                         Don't worry, D. B. Everything'll be 
taken care of!



                         Good.



                         Isn't it all too wonderful?

                         The group, chattering, exit into outer 
office.



                         (from the outer office)

                         Oh, Mr. Mayor, would you step right 
in the front row, please? Will you ladies 
get close to him? That's it!

                         Close-up: Of CONNELL. To inter-cut with 
above speech. He has been watching D. 
B.deeply disturbed about something.


                         Wider shot: All have left except CONNELL, 
TED, and D.B. CONNELL rises from his 
chairwith a deep sigh.



                         (shaking his head)

                         Well, I don't get it.



                         Huh? Get what?



                         Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my 
way around. This John Doe movement costs 
you a fortune. This convention's gonna 
cost plenty.



                         (annoyed)

                         Well?



                         Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut 
I'm a sucker if I can make four out 
of it.

                         (cocking his head)

                         Where do you come in?



                         Whyuh

                         (suddenly smiles)

                         Why, I'll have the satisfaction of knowing 
that my money has been spent for a worthy 
cause.



                         Close-up: of CONNELL. He stares at D. 
B. a moment. He realizes he has been 
told to mind his own business.

                         Two shot: CONNELL picks up his hat.




                         I see. I'd better stick to running the 
paper, huh?



                         I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd 
like to have the John Doe contract, 
all the receipts for the money we have 
advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell 
wrote, for which I gave her a thousand 
dollars.



                         Yes. Sure.

                         CONNELL leaves.

                         Dissolve to: Int. a hotel living roomnight. 
Full shot: ANN's luggage is packed and 
ready to be taken out. She stands near 
a desk stuffing papers into a manuscript 
case. She seems lost in worried thought. 
The door opens as CHARLIE, high pressure 
exploitation man, enters.



                         Well, we leave for the airport in half 
an hour. Is that Johnny-boy's room? 
I'd better hustle him up!



                         He'll be ready on time. He's packing 
now.



                         Ah, good!

                         (crosses to Ann)

                         Did you see his picture on the cover 
of Time ?



                         Yeah.

                         CHARLIE drops the magazine on the desk 
in front of her. ANN glances at it, 
unenthusiastically. CHARLIE goes to 
a table where there are several bottles 
of coca-cola and starts to pour himself 
a drink.



                         I gotta give you credit, Annie-girl. 
I've handled a good many big promotions 
in my time . . . everything from the 
world's fair to a channel swimmer, but 
this one has certainly got me spinning. 
And now a John Doe Convention! Wow! 
Say! If you could only get him to jump 
off the City Hall roof on Christmas 
Eve, I'd guarantee you half a million 
people there.



                         Charlie!

                         ANN is lost in troubled thought.



                         Huh?



                         (nods toward door)

                         What do you make of him?



                         Two shot: CHARLIE and ANN.



                         Who, Johnny-boy?

                         ANN nods.



                         Well, I don't know what angle you want, 
but I'll give it to you quick. Number 
one, he's got great yokel appeal; but 
he's a nice guy. Number two, he's beginning 
to believe he really wrote that original 
suicide letter that you made up. Number 
three, he thinks that you're Joan of 
Arc or something!

                         Close-up: Of ANN. This is definitely 
troublesome to her.



                         (hoarsely)

                         Yeah, I know.

                         Wider shot: ANN walks awaypacing perturbedly.




                         Number four, well, you know what number 
four is. He's nuts about you. Yeah, 
it's running out of his ears.

                         ANN runs her hand through her hair. 
Suddenly she wheels around to CHARLIE.




                         You left out number five. We're all 
heels, me especially.

                         She returns to her packing. CHARLIE 
watches her a second.



                         Holy smoke!

                         They are interrupted by a knock on the 
door.



                         (calling)

                         Come in.

                         JOHN enters, carrying a suitcase.



                         I'm all packed.



                         (starts out)

                         Good. I'll go and get Beany-boy.



                         (kidding him)

                         Okay, Charlie-boy!





                         Huh?

                         (laughing)[10]

                         CHARLIE winks good-naturedly and exits. 
JOHN turns to ANN, who concentrates 
on her packing.

                         Med. shot: He looks at ANN with great 
interest, and walks toward her, camera 
panning with him. ANN feels him coming, 
but does not turn.



                         (after a pause)

                         Can I help you pack?



                         No, thank you.

                         JOHN wanders over to a chair and sits 
on the edgewatching her.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. She is conscious of 
his eyes on her and fumbles with her 
packing. Finally she turns.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He stares at her, 
a warm smile on his face.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. She becomes self-conscious 
and resumes her packing.

                         Med. shot: JOHN.



                         Do you care if I sit down out here?




                         No.

                         A broad smile appears on JOHN'S face.




                         (laughing)

                         You know, I had a crazy dream last night. 
It was about you.



                         About me?



                         (laughing)

                         Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your 
father.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. The fact that he has 
seen himself in the image of her father 
disturbs her. She turns slowly.

                         Two shot: JOHN clears his throat nervously.




                         There was, there was something I was 
trying to stop you from doing. So, er, 
so I got up out of bed and I walked 
right through the wall here, right straight 
into your room.

                         (laughing)

                         You know how dreams are.

                         ANN stares at himfearful of the trend 
his dream is taking.





                         And there you were in bed.

                         (quickly apologizing)

                         But youyou were a little girl. You 
knowabout ten.

                         He pauses and recalls the scene.



                         And very pretty, too. So, I shook you, 
and the moment you opened your eyes, 
you hopped out of bed and started running 
like the devil, in your nightgown.


                         You ran right out the window there. 
And you ran out over the tops of buildings 
and roofs and everything for miles, 
and I was chasing you.

                         (laughing)

                         And all the time you were running you 
kept growing bigger and bigger and biggerand 
pretty soon you were as big as you are 
now. You know grown up. And all the 
time I kept asking myself, "What am 
I chasing her for?" And I didn't know.


                         (laughing)

                         Isn't that a hot one? Well, anyway, 
you ran into some place, and then Iran 
in after you andand when I got there, 
there you were getting married.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He suddenly becomes 
aware he is treading on sensitive grounds.




                         (awkwardly)

                         And the nightgown had changed into a 
beautiful wedding gown. You sure looked 
pretty, too.

                         (laughing)

                         And then I knew what it was I was trying 
to stop you from doing.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. She, too, begins to 
feel uncomfortablenot quite knowing 
how to handle it.

                         Two shot: JOHN glances at her.



                         Dreams are sure crazy, aren't they?


                         ANN smiles, noncommittedly.



                         Well, would you like to know who it 
was you were marrying?



                         (forced lightness)

                         Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.




                         No, not that bad. It was a fella that 
sends you flowers every day. Er, what's 
his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.



                         Close-up: Of ANN. She recognizes the 
significance in this.



                         (quietly)

                         Ted Sheldon.



                         Yeah, that's the one.

                         ANN turns back to her packing.

                         Wider shot: JOHN starts to chuckle.




                         But here's the funniest part of it all. 
I was the fella up there doing the marrying. 
You know, the Justice of the Peace or 
something . . .



                         You were? I thought you were chasing 
me?



                         Well, yes, I was. But I was your father 
then, see? But the real me, John Doe, 
er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I 
was the fellow up there with the book. 
You know what I mean?



                         (amused)

                         I guess so. Then what happened?



                         Well, I took you across my knee and 
I started spanking you.

                         ANN turns and stares at him, eyes widening.




                         (quickly explaining)

                         That is, I didn't do it.

                         (correcting himself)

                         I mean, I did do it, but it wasn't me. 
You see, I was your father then. Well, 
I laid you across my knee and I said: 
"Annie, I won't allow you to marry a 
man that's, that's just rich, or that 
has his secretary send you flowers. 
The man you marry has got to swim rivers 
for you! He's got to climb high mountains 
for you! He's got to slay dragons for 
you! He's got to perform wonderful deeds 
for you! Yes, sir!"

                         BEANY enters and stands back of him, 
listening.



                         And all the time, er, the guy up there, 
you know, with the book, me, just stood 
there nodding his head and he said, 
"Go to it, Pop, whack her one for me, 
because that's just the way I feel about 
it, too."

                         So he says, "Come on down here and whack 
her yourself." So I came down and I 
whacked you a good one, see? And then 
he whacked oneand I whacked you another 
one, and we both started whacking you 
like . . .



                         He demonstrates by slapping his knees, 
first with one hand and then with the 
other. Suddenly he becomes aware of 
BEANY and stops, embarrassed.



                         (interrupting)

                         Well, if you're through whacking her, 
come on, let's get going.

                         (to bell boys)

                         Okay, fellows, right in here.

                         (to JOHN)

                         You go out the side entrance. There's 
a bunch of autograph seekers out front. 
We'll be down with the bags in a minute. 
Come on!

                         (speaking to boys)

                         Don't make a government project out 
of this!

                         The bell boys have lifted her luggage 
and all exit.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He has been left 
with his proposal unfinished.

                         Dissolve to: Int. airport lunchroomnight. 
Med. shot: Scene opens with BEANY entering 
airport lunchroom to end of counter 
at which CHARLIE is seated.



                         How're you, Beany?



                         When does our plane take off again.




                         In a couple of minutes.

                         Camera moves down counter to pick up 
JOHN and ANN at table. They sit silently 
for a moment. We hear the strains of 
music from a "juke" box.



                         (after a pause)

                         How many people do you think we've talked 
to already, outside the radio, I mean?




                         I don't know. About three hundred thousand.




                         Three hundred thousand? What makes them 
do it, Ann? What makes them come and 
listen and, and get up their John Doe 
Clubs the way they do? I've been trying 
to figure it out.



                         (in an effort to disillusion him)

                         Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are 
platitudes. Things they've heard a million 
times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds 
have silver linings," "Turn the other 
cheek." It's just a





                         (sincerely)

                         Yeah, I've heard them a million times, 
too, butthere you are. Maybe they're 
like me. Just beginning to get an idea 
what those things mean.

                         ANN is deeply concerned. She watches 
him, helplessly.



                         (continuing)

                         You know, I never thought much about 
people before. They were always just 
somebody to fill up the bleachers. The 
only time I worried about them was if 
theyis when they didn't come in to 
see me pitch. You know, lately I've 
been watching them while I talked to 
them. I could see something in their 
faces. I could feel that they were hungry 
for something. Do you know what I mean?


                         ANN nods.



                         Maybe that's why they came. Maybe they 
were just lonely and wanted somebody 
to say hello to. I know how they feel. 
I've been lonely and hungry for something 
practically all my life.

                         ANN forces a smile. The moment threatens 
to become awkwarduntil they are saved 
by the pilot's voice.



                         All aboard, folks!

                         They suddenly snap out of their moodand 
as they rise:

                         Fade out.

                         Fade in: Int. D. B.'s dining room. Full 
shot: As D. B., ANN and TED SHELDON 
enter and cross to table. ANN starts 
to sit and notices a fur coat flung 
over the back of the chair.



                         Oh, somebody else sitting there?



                         No, no, nothat's your seat.



                         And this is your coat.



                         Mine?



                         A little token of appreciation.

                         Ann pauses a moment, glances toward 
D. B.while TED throws the coat over 
her shoulders.





                         (glances into a mirror)

                         Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI 
don't quite know what to say . . .




                         Well, don't say anything at all. Just 
sit down.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. She sits down, picks 
up her servietteand something she sees 
suddenly makes her look with surprise 
at D. B.

                         Camera pans down to a jewel box which 
had been under the serviette.

                         Camera pans back to ANN. She glances 
up at D. B. somewhat bewildered.



                         Oh!



                         Go ahead, open it, open it.

                         ANN opens the box and holds up a lovely 
diamond bracelet. Her eyes dance.




                         Oh! Oh, it's lovely!



                         And a new contract goes with it.

                         Wider shot: D. B. and TED exchange satisfied 
glances. ANN admires the bracelet on 
her wristand then turns to D. B., looks 
directly at him.



                         (shrewdly)

                         Well, come on, spring it! You've got 
something on your mind.

                         D. B. laughs.



                         Must be stupendous.

                         Wider shot: As D. B. roars with laughter.




                         You know, that's what I like about her. 
Right to the point, like that! All right, 
practical Annie, here it is.

                         He leans forward. ANN waits. TED watches 
her face.

                         Two shot: ANN and D. B.



                         Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen 
thousand people, and talking over a 
nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe 
will announce the formation of a third 
party.





                         (eyes widening)

                         A third party?



                         Yes. The John Doe Party.

                         Wider shot: TED watches ANN, expectantly.




                         Devoted entirely to the interests of 
all the John Does all over the country. 
Which practically means, ninety per 
cent of the voters. He will also announce 
the third party's candidate for the 
presidency. A man whom he, personally, 
recommends. A great humanitarian; the 
best friend the John Does have.



                         (in an awed whisper)

                         Mr. D. B. Norton!

                         D. B. verifies her guess by leaning 
back, a pleased grin on his face, his 
huge chest expanded.



                         Yes.

                         Ann looks from one to the other, a little 
awed by the size of the project.



                         (on her breath)

                         Wow!

a bee-hive of activity. Announcers walk 
about with "mikes" in their handsall

scene below.

                         And although the opening of the convention 
is hours off, the delegates are already 
pouring into the ball park by the droves, 
with lunch baskets, banners and petitions, 
asking John Doe not to jump off any 
roof . . .

                         Camera pans over to KNOX MANNING.



                         It is still a phenomenal movement. The 
John Does, or the hoi polloi as you've 
heard people call them, have been laughed 
at and ridiculed but here they are, 
gay and happy, having traveled thousands 
of miles, their expenses paid by their 
neighbors, to come here to pay homage 
to their hero, John Doe.

                         Camera pans over to JOHN B. HUGHES.






                         And in these days of wars and bombings, 
it's a hopeful sign that a simple idea 
like this can sweep the country, an 
idea based on friendliness, on giving 
and not taking, on helping your neighbor 
and asking nothing in return. And if 
a thing like this can happen, don't 
let any of our grumbling friends tell 
you that humanity is falling apart. 
This is John B. Hughes, signing off 
now and returning you to our main studio 
until nine o'clock when the convention 
will officially open.

                         Dissolve to: Int. ANN's living room. 
Med. shot: At Door. ANN's MOTHER opens 
it and JOHN stands on the threshold. 
He has a small box of flowers in his 
hand. Water drips from his hat.



                         Oh, John. Come in.



                         Say, I'm kindait's raining out a little




                         That's all right.

                         Wider shot: MRS. MITCHELL lays his hat 
down somewhere. John takes a few steps 
inside the room, not quite knowing what 
to do.



                         (turning to him)

                         It's good to see you. Sit down.



                         (mumbles)

                         Thanks.

                         He sits on the edge of a sofa, still 
clinging to the little box. Then holds 
box out awkwardly.



                         (awkwardly)

                         It's for Ann . . .



                         (taking the box)

                         Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.




                         Flowers.



                         I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.




                         She isn't?



                         No, she just left. I'm surprised you 
didn't run into her. She went over to 
Mr. Norton's house.



                         Oh!





                         Did you want to see her about something 
important?



                         Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.


                         (suddenly)

                         Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. 
Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done 
an awful lot for the

                         Close-up: Of MRS. MITCHELL. She watches 
him, amused.



                         Say, my coat's pretty wet. I'm afraid 
I might have wet the couch a little.


                         Wider shot: JOHN is still struggling 
to find conversation.



                         Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention 
later.



                         Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets 
the flowers.

                         He rises and looks around for hat on 
the floor and back of the chair.



                         Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.




                         (finds his hat and gives it to him)


                         Good night, John.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He starts away and 
suddenly stops, speculatively. He glances 
out of the corner of his eye toward 
                         MRS. MITCHELL.



                         (going back to her)

                         Say, Mrs. Mitchell, I, er, I'm kinda 
glad Ann isn't here. You see, I was, 
I came over here hoping to see her alone 
and kinda hoping I wouldn't, too. You 
know what I mean? There was something 
I wanted to talk to her about. But, 
well, IIt'll wait, I guess. Good night.


                         Close-up: Of MRS. MITCHELL. She begins 
to sense what is on his mind, and her 
face becomes serious.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He smiles helplessly. 
Starts toward door.



                         Good night, John.

                         Two shot: JOHN and MRS. MITCHELL. He 
stares at her a second.



                         (suddenly)

                         Say, look, Mrs. Mitchell, have you ever 
been married?



                         (catches himself)

                         Oh, sure you have.

                         (grins sheepishly)

                         Gosh! That's pretty silly! I guess you 
must think I'm kinda batty!

                         JOHN shakes his head at his own stupidity.




                         (can't get over it)

                         Well, I guess I'd better be going at 
that!

                         He bows again, and starts for the door. 
When he gets there, he is stopped by 
MRS. MITCHELL's voice.



                         John. My husband said: "I love you. 
Will you marry me?"



                         (whirls)

                         He did? What happened?



                         I married him.

                         JOHN comes right back to her.

                         Two shot: JOHN and MRS. MITCHELL.



                         (full of excitement)

                         Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It 
was easy as all that, huh?



                         Uh-huh.



                         Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, 
you know I love Ann and it's gonna be 
awfully hard for me to say it because, 
well, you know, she's so wonderful, 
and, well, the best I ever was was a 
bush-league pitcher.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN.



                         And you know, I think she's in love 
with another man, the one she made up. 
You know, the real John Doe. Well, that's 
pretty tough competition.

                         Two shot: JOHN and MRS. MITCHELL. She 
is terribly fond of JOHN and deeply 
sympathetic.



                         I bet you he'd know how to say it all 
right. And me, I get up to it and around 
it and in back of it, but, but I never 
get right to it. Do you know what I 
mean? So the only chance I've got is, 
well, if somebody could kinda give her 
a warning sort of, sorta prepare her 
for the shock!





                         You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?




                         Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you 
know, sort of break the ice.

                         Close-up of MOTHER. She doesn't know 
how she can, with her present strained 
relationship with ANN, but JOHN's sincerity 
touches her.



                         Of course I will, John.

                         Two shot: JOHN's face lights up, gratefully.




                         Gee whiz! Thank you, Mrs. Mitchell.


                         (grabs her hand)

                         Gee, you'reuhyou're okay!

                         He exits from scenebut almost immediately 
he is back. He plants a kiss on her 
cheek and goes.

apartment. Med. Shot: An automobile 
stands at the curb, in front of which 
is BEANY. Also waiting, are four motorcycle 
policeman.



                         (to the other men)

                         This John Doe meeting is gonna be one 
of the biggest things that ever happened.


                         As JOHN appears in the doorway of the 
apartment house, he pretends to throw 
a baseball at them.



                         Why, they're coming from all over; trains, 
box cars, wagons

                         (sees JOHN)

                         look out!

the door open for JOHN.



                         Hello, bodyguards! Hey, had your dinner 
yet?



                         Not yet.

dinner. I'll

                         He is about to enter the car when a 
voice from off-scene stops him.



                         Wait a minute, John.

                         Camera pans over to a taxicab which 
has just driven in. CONNELL hands the 
driver a bill and walks, rather unsteadily 
toward JOHN.

                         Med. shot: Around BEANY's car. CONNELL 
ambles into the scene.





                         Hello, Mr. Connell.



                         Hiyah, John.

                         (broad wink)

                         John, I want to have a little talk with 
you.

                         (lurchesJohn holds him up)

                         What's the matterare you falling? Come 
here.

                         Takes his arm to lead him off.



                         (protesting)

                         Hey, Boss.



                         Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.

                         (to John)

                         Say, tell me something did you read 
that speech you're gonna make tonight?




                         No, I never read the speeches before 
I make them. I get more of a kick out 
of it that way.



                         (wisely)

                         Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. 
Beany, go on down to the office, tell 
Pop to give you the speech. There's 
a copy on my desk.



                         (protesting)

                         Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton 
told me not to leave him, not even for 
a minute.



                         (shooing him away)

                         Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at 
Jim's Bar up the street.

                         He points in the general direction and 
again takes JOHN's arm. JOHN watches 
him, rather amused to see CONNELL off 
his milk diet, and allows himself to 
be led away.

                         Wipe to: Int. a barroom. Close shot: 
In a corner booth, JOHN and CONNELL 
sit, close together, drinks in front 
of them. JOHN's drink has remained untouched. 
CONNELL is just taking a long swig. 
From off-scene we hear the strains of 
an old-fashioned torch ballad, coming 
from an automatic piano.



                         (after a pause)

                         You're a nice guy, John. I like you. 
You're gentle. I like gentle people. 
Me? I'm hardhard and tough.

                         (shakes his headdisparagingly)

                         I got no use for hard people. Gotta 
be gentle to suit me. Like you, for 
instance.



                         JOHN smiles, amused at him. CONNELL 
starts to light his cigarette, which 
is bent. He hold the match up, but it 
never reaches the tip of the bent cigarette. 
He puffs, satisfied.



                         Yep, I'm hard. But you want to know 
something? I've got a weakness. You'd 
never guess that, would you? Well, I 
have. Want to know what it is?

                         JOHN nods.



                         The Star Spangled Banner.

                         (looks directly at John)

                         Screwy, huh?

                         (turns back to his glass)

                         Well, maybe it is. But play the "Star 
Spangled Banner"and I'm a sucker for 
it. It always gets me right here


                         (thumps his diaphragm)

                         You know what I mean?

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. His face has become 
serious.



                         Yeah.

                         (points to back of neck)

                         It gets me right back here.

                         Two shot: JOHN and CONNELL. CONNELL 
speculates about this with his head 
cocked.



                         Oh, back there, huh?

                         (shrugs, dismissing it)

                         Well, every man to his own taste.

                         JOHN smiles at him. CONNELL tries lighting 
his bent cigarette againwith the same 
resultwhile JOHN watches, amused.




                         You weren't old enough for the first 
world war, were you?

                         JOHN starts to answer, but CONNELL goes 
right on.



                         Course not. Must have been a kid.

                         He pours JOHN's drink into his own glass.




                         I was. I was just ripe. And rarin' to 
go.

                         (takes drink)

                         Know what my old man did when I joined 
up? He joined up too.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He finds himself 
intensely interested.



                         Got to be a sergeant.



                         Two shot: JOHN and CONNELL.



                         (as he raises his glass)

                         That's a kick for you. We were in the 
same outfit. Funny, huh?

                         Close-up: Of CONNELL. He lifts his glass 
to his lips, and without drinking, lowers 
it.



                         (voice lowers)

                         He was killed, John.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. His face enveloped 
in an expression of sympathy.

                         Two shot: CONNELL stares down at the 
glass which he revolves between his 
palms.



                         I saw him get it. I was right there 
and saw it with my own eyes.

                         Without glancing at JOHN, he lifts the 
glass and drains it.



                         (turns to JOHN)

                         Me? I came out of it without a scratch. 
Except for my ulcers. Should be drinking 
milk.

                         (picks up his glass)

                         This stuff's poison.

                         As he holds up his glass, he realizes 
it is empty.



                         (yelling to bartender)

                         Hey, Tubby!



                         Yes, Mr. Connell?



                         (indicates the empty glass)

                         Whadda you say?



                         All right.

                         Close shot: JOHN and CONNELL. CONNELL 
looks around guardedly, to make certain 
he is not overhead.



                         (confidentially)

                         Yessir. I'm a sucker for this country.


                         (gets a little sore about it)

                         I'm a sucker for the Star Spangled Bannerand 
I'm a sucker for this country.

                         (taps table with his middle finger)


                         I like what we got here! I like it!




                         (emphasizes each point)

                         A guy can say what he wantsand do what 
he wantswithout having a bayonet shoved 
through his belly.

                         Med. shot: As he leans back and nods 
his head, satisfied he made his point.




                         Now, that's all right, isn't it?



                         You betcha.

                         The BARTENDER comes in with drink and 
departs.



                         All right. And we don't want anybody 
coming around changing it, do we?


                         JOHN shakes his head.



                         No, sir.

                         Two shot: JOHN and CONNELL.



                         No, sir. And when they do I get mad! 
I get b-boiling mad. And right now, 
John, I'm sizzling!

                         JOHN looks at him, puzzled.



                         I get mad for a lot of other guys besides 
myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! 
And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. 
Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a 
foggy world! You know what I mean?




                         (huskily)

                         Yeah, you bet!

                         CONNELL takes a drink and looks at JOHN 
a moment before he speaks.



                         (leans on the table)

                         Listen, palthis fifth column stuff's 
pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]



                         Yeah. It certainly is.



                         And you'd feel like an awful sucker 
if you found yourself marching right 
in the middle of it, wouldn't you?


                         JOHN glances up sharply.





                         And you, of course you wouldn't know 
it because you're gentle. But that's 
what you're doing. You're mixed up with 
a skunk, my boy, a no-good, dangerous 
skunk!

                         JOHN'S resentment vanishesand is replaced 
by puzzlement.



                         Say, you're not talking about Mr. Norton, 
are you?

                         Two shot: JOHN and CONNELL.



                         (emphatically)

                         I'm not talking about his grandfather's 
pet poodle!

                         CONNELL again makes an effort to light 
his bent cigaretteand again is unsuccessful.




                         You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause 
he's been marvelous about the John Doe 
Clubs.



                         (sarcastically)

                         Yeah?

                         (suddenly)

                         Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, 
aren't you?



                         Sure.



                         Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.

                         Close-up: Of CONNELL.



                         (sincerely)

                         It's a beautiful miracle. A miracle 
that could only happen right here in 
the good old U.S.A. And I think it's 
terrific! What do you think of that! 
Me! Hard-boiled Connell! I think it's 
plenty terrific!

                         Two shot: John is rather pleased to 
hear him say this.



                         All right! Now, supposing a certain 
unmentionable worm, whose initials are 
D. B., was trying to use that to shove 
his way into the White House. So he 
could put the screws on, so he could 
turn out the lights in those lighthouses. 
What would you say about that? Huh?






                         Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. 
They can't use the John Doe Clubs for 
politics. That's the main idea.



                         Is that so? Then what's a big political 
boss like Hammett doing in town? And 
a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot 
of other big shots who are up at D. 
B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, 
wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!


                         (snorting)

                         Wait till you get a gander at that speech 
you're gonna make tonight!



                         You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes 
those speeches and nobody can make her 
write that kind of stuff.



                         (cynically)

                         They can't, huh?

                         (then barking)

                         Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt 
Emma? I know she writes them.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. His jaw stiffens, 
angrily.



                         And get a big bonus for doing them, 
too. A mink coat and a diamond bracelet.


                         JOHN glares at him, his rage mounting.


                         Close-up: Of CONNELL. Unaware of JOHN's 
wrath.



                         Don't write 'em? Why, that gold-grabbin' 
dame would double-cross her own mother 
for a handful of Chinese yen!



                         (in an outraged outcry)

                         Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd


                         Simultaneously his hand comes in and 
grabs the startled CONNELL violently 
by his shirt front, lifting him out 
of his seat. Camera pulls back to include 
JOHNwho towers over CONNELL.

                         Wider shot: JOHN is still holding CONNELL, 
glaring down at him, enraged, when BEANY 
runs into the scene.



                         (holding out the envelope)

                         Hey, Boss! Here's the speech, Boss.


                         Suddenly he sees what's happening, and 
stares open-mouthed.



                         Hey!



                         Med. shot: As JOHN pushes CONNELL back 
into the seat, snatches the envelope 
from BEANY, and exits.



                         Go on and read it, John, and then start 
socking!

                         Wider shot: As JOHN exits from place. 
BEANY suddenly realizes he has goneand 
chases after him.



                         Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!



                          . . . Tubby?



                         Yes, sir?



                         Better bring me a glass of milk.

                         Close-up: Of CONNELL. He stares at his 
unlighted cigarettegrimaces unhappily.




                         (mumbling)

                         I'm smoking too much.

                         He grinds out the unlighted cigarette 
in the tray.

                         Dissolve to: Int. D. B.'s dining room. 
Close shot: Of D. B., who is at head 
of table, talking on phone.



                         (into telephone)

                          . . . Yes, Charlie? You've got everything 
all set? Fine! Has John Doe been taken 
care of? Good! How many people do you 
think will be there?

                         A pleased expression comes over his 
face.



                         Fifteen thousand? Oh my, that's fine. 
Now, listen, Charlie, as soon as John 
Doe stops talking about me, I want you 
to start that demonstration. And make 
it a big one, you understand?

                         As D. B. hangs up.

                         Wider shot: Including TED SHELDON.




                         Don't worry about that, D. B. My boys 
are there. They'll take care of it.




                         (into telephone)

                         What? yes, I'll be there fifteen minutes 
after I get your call.

                         Camera draws back as he speaks. We see 
that dinner has been concluded. His 
listeners, besides TED and ANN, are 
half a dozen distinguished looking men, 
some with cigars stuck in their mouths, 
others sip from champagne glasses. ANN 
sits to D. B.'s right.

                         Cut to: Int. foyer: Med. shot: At D. 
B.'s front door. A butler is opening 
the door for JOHN.





                         Why, Mr. Doe . . .



                         Where are they?



                         In the dining room, sir.

                         JOHN strides toward the dining room. 
Camera pans with JOHN, who is dripping 
wet, as he crosses the foyer until he 
comes within sight of the open door 
of the dining room. JOHN stops.

                         Cut back to: Int. D. B.'s dining room. 
Wider shot: D. B. addressing the group 
at the table.



                         Well, gentlemen, I think we're about 
ready to throw that great big bombshell




                         Yeah, well it's about time.



                         Even a conservative estimate shows that 
we can count on anywhere between ten 
and twenty million John Doe votes. Now, 
add to that the labor vote that Mr. 
Bennett will throw in . . .

                         He indicates BENNETT who nods, importantly.




                          . . . and the votes controlled by Mr. 
Hammett and the rest of you gentlemen 
in your territories

                         (emphatically)

                         and nothing can stop us!

                         Close-up: Of ANN. She seems distressed. 
She apparently has been listening to 
things that have caused her considerable 
anxiety.

                         Wider shot: WESTON leans forward and 
speaks to D. B.



                         As I said before, I'm with youproviding 
you can guarantee the John Doe vote.




                         Don't worry about that.



                         You can count on me under one condition. 
Little Bennett's gotta be taken care 
of!



                         Didn't I tell you that everybody in 
this room would be taken care? My agreement 
with you gentlemen stands!



                         I'm with you, D. B., but I still think 
it's a very daring thing we're attempting!






                         These are daring times, Mr. Barrington. 
We're coming to a new order of things. 
There's been too much talk going on 
in this country.



                         Exactly

                         ANN glances up at D. B., a startled 
look in her eyes.

                         Close shot: D. B.'s audience beams with 
satisfaction as he continues.



                         Too many concessions have been made! 
What the American people need is an 
iron hand!



                         You're right!



                         That's true. You're quite right, D. 
                         B.!



                         Discipline!



                         Quite right! Exactly!

                         There are cries of: "Hear, hear!" and 
applause.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. She is completely 
seized by panicand although she attempts 
applauding, it is feeble.

                         Med. shot: Shooting through open door 
toward dining room. Prominently in view 
is ANN, still lost in troubled thought. 
D. B. is still on his feet.



                         And now

                         (lifting champagne glass)

                         may I offer a little toast to Miss Ann 
Mitchellthe brilliant and beautiful 
lady who is responsible for all this!


                         The men rise.



                         Miss Mitchell! Miss Mitchell!



                         Mr. Norton, I'd like to talk to you 
alone for a moment.



                         Oh, oh.

                         (chortling)

                         Miss Mitchell has something to say to 
us.



                         Well, that's fine. Speech! Speech!


                         Ann spots John.





                         (spotting John)

                         Hello?



                         John! I'm so glad to see you. II was 
terribly worried.



                         (showing her a copy of the speech)


                         Did you write this?



                         Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea 
what was going on.



                         You didn't?

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. His mouths screws 
up bitterly.



                         (quiet contempt)

                         That's a swell bracelet you're wearing.


                         He leaves her, abruptly.

                         Int. dining room: Full shot: JOHN enters 
and looks the men over appraisingly 
as he goes toward D. B. They all stare 
at him.



                         John

                         (concerned)

                         Why aren't you at the convention?

                         JOHN doesn't answer.



                         Is there anything wrong?



                         (after a pause)

                         Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's 
fine! So there's gonna be a new order 
of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut 
himself a nice, fat slice of the John 
Does, eh?

                         (turns toward D. B.)

                         You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou 
forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. 
Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's 
gonna use the John Doe clubs for his 
own rotten purpose, he's gonna have 
to do it over my dead body!



                         Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold 
on! That's rather big talk! I started 
the John Doe clubs with my money and 
I'll decide whether or not they're being 
properly used!



                         No you won't! You're through deciding 
anything!

                         D. B. cannot believe his ears.





                         And what's more, I'm going down to that 
convention and I'm gonna tell those 
people exactly what you and all your 
fine-feathered friends here are trying 
to cook up for them!

                         He looks up at ANNand starts tearing 
the speech in his hand.



                         (strongly)

                         And I'll say it in my own words this 
time.

                         He flings the torn paper toward ANNand 
starts out.



                         Stop him, somebody! He'll ruin us, D. 
                         B.!

                         Med. shot: At Door. As JOHN reaches 
it, TED steps up in front of him.




                         (menacingly)

                         Wait a minute, young fellermy uncle 
wants to talk to you.

                         D. B. walks up to JOHN.



                         Listen to me, my son! Before you lose 
your head completely, may I remind you 
that I picked you up out of the gutter 
and I can throw you right back there 
again! You've got a nerve accusing people 
of things! These gentlemen and I know 
what's the best for the John Does of 
America, regardless of what tramps like 
you think!

                         Get off that righteous horse of yours 
and come to your senses. You're the 
fake! We believe in what we're doing! 
You're the one that was paid the thirty 
pieces of silver! Have you forgotten 
that? Well, I haven't!

                         You're a fake, John Doe, and I can prove 
it! You're the big hero that's supposed 
to jump off tall buildings and things! 
Do you remember? What do you suppose 
your precious John Does will say when 
they find out that you never had any 
intention of doing it? That you were 
being paid to say so? You're lucky if 
they don't run you out of the country!


                         Why, with the newspapers and the radio 
stations that these gentlemen control, 
we can kill the John Doe movement deader 
than a doornail, and we'll do it, too, 
the moment you step out of line! Now, 
if you still want to go to that convention 
and shoot your trap off, you go ahead 
and do it!

                         Full shot: D. B. leaves JOHN and returns 
to his chair. JOHN stares at him, unbelievingly.


                         Close shot: of JOHN.





                         (after a pause)

                         Do you mean to tell me you'd try to 
kill the John Doe movement if you can't 
use it to get what you want?



                         You bet your bottom dollar we would!




                         (cynically)

                         Well, that certainly is a new low. I 
guess I've seen everything now.

                         Wider shot: As JOHN's lips curl up contemptuously 
and he steps up to the table.



                         (throwing his hat on the table)

                         You sit there back of your big cigars 
and think of deliberately killing an 
idea that's made millions of people 
a little bit happier! An idea that's 
brought thousands of them here from 
all over the country, by bus and by 
freight, in jallopies and on footso 
they could pass on to each other their 
own simple little experiences.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. Her eyes light up 
happily.



                         Why, look, I'm just a mug and I know 
it. But I'm beginning to understand 
a lot of things. Why, your type's old 
as history. If you can't lay your dirty 
fingers on a decent idea and twist it 
and squeeze it and stuff it into your 
own pocket, you slap it down! Like dogs, 
if you can't eat something, you bury 
it!

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. His voice is pleading.




                         Why, this is the one worthwhile thing 
that's come along. People are finally 
finding out that the guy next door isn't 
a bad egg. That's simple, isn't it? 
And yet a thing like that's got a chance 
of spreading till it touches every last 
doggone human being in the worldand 
you talk about killing it!

                         Full shot: They listen to himunmoved.




                         Why, when this fire dies down, what's 
going to be left? More misery, more 
hunger and more hate. And what's to 
prevent that from starting all over 
again? Nobody knows the answer to that 
one, and certainly not you, with those 
slimy, bolloxed-up theories you've got! 
The John Doe idea may be the answer, 
though! It may be the one thing capable 
of saving this cockeyed world! Yet you 
sit back there on your fat hulks and 
tell me you'll kill it if you can't 
use it!



                         Well, you go ahead and try! You couldn't 
do it in a million years, with all your 
radio stations and all your power! Because 
it's bigger than whether I'm a fake! 
It's bigger than your ambitions! And 
it's bigger than all the bracelets and 
fur coats in the world!

                         Wider shot: ANN runs to JOHN.



                         (sincerely)

                         You bet it is, John!

                         JOHN starts to exit.

                         Med. shot: Shooting toward door.



                         (turning to them)

                         And that's exactly what I'm going down 
there to tell those people!

                         As JOHN reaches door, TED SHELDON jumps 
in front of him.

                         Close shot:



                         Wait a minute, you ungrateful rat! My 
Uncle's been too good to

                         While he speaks, JOHN looks down at 
the fist clutching his shirt, and then, 
with a suddenness that startles TED, 
he steps aside and clips TED on the 
jaw. TED's knees buckle and he goes 
down. JOHN exits.

                         Wider shot: As several men rush to TED's 
assistance. D. B. does not move.



                         He's getting away!



                         John!

                         Ext. entrance to D. B.'s house: Med. 
shot: As JOHN hurries out. He goes by 
half a dozen members of TED SHELDON's 
motorcycle troops who wait around to 
escort D. B. to the convention.

                         Int. Dining room: Full shot: The room 
is full of commotion. ANN is running 
out of the room, going after JOHN. Several 
men bend over TED. D. B. glares toward 
door, his face hardening. HAMMETT is 
barking at him.

                         D. B. reaches under the table, lifts 
up two phones. Hands one to HAMMETT.




                         Get the Bulletin !

                         He, himself, dials the other phone.




                         John!





                         I've always told you, D. B. you're playing 
with dynamite!



                         (calling to men)

                         Don't let that girl get away!

                         The butler rushes out.



                         Before he gets through tonight he'll 
ruin us all!



                         You've got to stop him, D. B.!



                         I'll stop him! I'll stop him cold! Don't 
worry, I've been ready for this!

                         Cut to: Ext. D. B.'s entranceat gate. 
Med. shot: As ANN runs alongside JOHN.




                         John! Oh, John, please listen to me! 
PleaseI can explain everything, John. 
I didn't know what they were going to 
do! Let me go with you, John! John, 
please!

                         JOHN gets into taxislams doorANN runs 
beside cab as it starts off.



                         Go ahead, driver! Ball park!



                         John, please let me go with you! Please, 
John!

                         Several troopers grab ANN.



                         Mr. Norton wants to see you.



                         Oh!

                         As the men get a firmer grip on her 
and ANN fights to get loose: Cut to: 
Int. D. B.'s study: Med. shot: D. B. 
is on the phone. The others pace around, 
perturbedly. HAMMETT has the second 
phone in his hand.



                         (into phone)

                         Listen to me, Mayor Lovett, you do as 
I say. I want them both arrested. You 
tell the police department to pick up 
Connell. I've got the girl here.



                         (holds out phone)

                         I've got the Bulletin !





                         (hotly)

                         I don't care what you charge them with! 
If you're worried, let them go in the 
morning, but keep them in jail over 
night!

                         He bangs up the receiver. Grabs another 
phone from HAMMETT.



                         Hello, Bulletin ? Put Pop Dwyer on.


                         Dissolve to: Ext. entrance to ball park: 
Med. shot: Over the entrance gate a 
huge banner reads:





                         People come from all directions and 
pour through the gates. Some carry umbrellas 
over their heads, others have their 
coat collars turned up. Women hold newspapers 
over their heads to protect their hats. 
It is a misty, drizzling rain.

                         Ext. ball park: Long shot: Shooting 
from ANNOUNCER's view down at the Speaker's 
platform which has been erected on "Home 
Plate." On it, in the rear, is a brass 
band. In front of it is a speaker's 
table, over which dangles the microphone 
of a public address system. Attached 
to the table are several microphones 
with names of broadcasting stations 
on them.

                         Med. shot: Shooting toward audience. 
They sing: "Oh, Susanna."

                         Med. shot: Toward people seated in grandstand. 
They join in the singing.

                         Another angle: Toward a third section. 
They also pick up the song.

                         Long shot: Taking in as many as possible. 
Everyone sings, and the volume has risen 
considerably.

                         Med. shot: Shooting down an aisle. A 
stream of people take up the song, as 
they march to their seats.

                         Med. shot: At entrance to Park. Crowds 
are coming inand they, too, begin singing. 
They are also joined by the policemen 
posted at the gates.

                         Med. shot: A second entrance to Park. 
Another crowd is entering, also singing.


                         Med. shot: Of BERT and SOURPUSS in the 
foreground of a group on platform, all 
of whom sing. BERT has a large rolled-up 
scroll in his hand.

                         Close-up: Of the COLONEL. Sitting in 
a corner somewhere, looking around speculatively, 
with a stubborn mental reservation that 
they are still all heelots.

                         Several close shots: Of small groupswith 
their wet faces held high, singing lustily, 
eyes sparkling.

                         Long shot: Shooting from the platform 
down toward the audience. The song finally 
comes to a climaxand immediately, lusty 
cheering starts, as they see JOHN coming 
on platform.

                         Med. shot: Toward platform. JOHN goes 
to the microphone of the public address 
system.





                         Three cheers for John Doe!



                         Listen, ladies and gentlemen!

                         Before he can go any further, the band 
strikes up the strain of "AMERICA" and 
immediately the large assembly begins 
singing it.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. As his lips form 
the words. His expression is solemn.


                         Various shots: Of groups, singing.


                         Long shot: As people sing. Finally the 
song is ended, and an enthusiastic cheer 
is emitted by the crowd.

                         Med. shot: On platform. JOHN again steps 
toward the microphone and makes another 
effort to speak, but the CLERGYMAN places 
a detaining hand on his arm.



                         Just a moment, John. We begin with a 
short prayer.

                         Longer shot: Shooting over the heads 
of the audience toward the platform 
in the background. Gradually the cheering 
subsides.



                         (speaking into public address system)


                         Quiet, please. Ladies and gentlemenlet 
us have a moment of silent prayer for 
the John Does all over the world . . 
. many of whom are homeless and hungry. 
Rise, please. Everybody rise.

                         The CLERGYMAN and JOHN, standing next 
to him, immediately bow their heads.


                         Long shot: Shooting toward audience. 
As far as the Camera eye can see, heads 
are bowed in prayer. The reflection 
on the wet umbrellas creates a strange 
and mystic light.

                         Several close shots: Of small groupsin 
silent prayer.

                         Close-up: Of the COLONEL. Rather grudgingly, 
he has his head lowered.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. His eyes are shuthis 
face wreathed in an expression of compassion.


                         Med. shot: At press section. They, too, 
bow respectfully. The reporters are 
quiet for the first time.

                         Ext. street: Long shot: Directly in 
front of entrance to ball park. A stream 
of news trucks pull up, filled with 
newsboysthey immediately alight.


                         Ext. street: Med. shot: In front of 
another entrance. More trucks arrivepacked 
with newsboys.

                         Ext. street: Med. shot: Shooting toward 
entrance. As an army of newsboys, each 
carrying a stack of newspapers, run 
toward us yelling:





                         Extry, extry! Read all about it!

                         Med. shot: Toward another entrance. 
Another swarm of newsboys dash in, also 
shouting.



                         Extry! John Doe a fake!

                         Long shot: Of audience with their heads 
still bowed. Slowly, they begin turning 
around, puzzled, as from all directions 
and down every aisle, boys are running, 
waving papers in the air.



                         (shouting)

                         Here you are! John Doe a fake! Read 
all about it! John Doe movement a racket!


                         Close shot: Of JOHN. He looks up, terror-stricken.


                         Med. shot: At press section. Great excitement 
prevails here.



                         Newsboys! Hundreds of yelling newsboys 
are swarming into the park like locusts! 
They're yelling, "John Doe's a fake! 
Fake!"

                         Med. shot: Of audience. As newsboys 
are distributing papers to the baffled 
people.



                         Here you are! No charge! John Doe a 
fake!

                         Med. shot: Of a second group. Some already 
have papers and peer, unbelievingly, 
at the headlines. Others grab papers 
from newsboys' hands.



                         (reading)

                         "Federal investigation urged by Chamber 
of Commerce."

                         Med. shot: Speaker's platform. SOURPUSS 
and BERT, reading paper.



                         How could he be a fake?

                         (laughing)



                         It must be some kind of a gag.



                         A what?



                         A gag. A gag!

                         Ext. : Somewhere inside ball park: Long 
shot: We hear the shrieking of sirens 
and almost immediately a limousine, 
escorted by Sheldon's motorcycle troops, 
pulls up. Directly behind it is a string 
of cars.



                         Med. shot: The door of the limousine 
flies open and D. B. comes out. He immediately 
heads for the platform.

                         Camera pans over and we see troopers 
pouring out of the cars with TED SHELDON 
directing them.



                         Come on, come on, step on it! Step on 
it! Step on it! You all know your places 
now, so let's get going! Wait for the 
signal!

                         Med. shot: DRUNK with a balloon. He 
holds balloon up to TED, getting in 
TED's way.



                         Hey, mister, will you autograph my balloon?




                         Sure!

                         (and breaks balloon)



                         (pushing drunk aside)

                         Gangway!

                         Ext.: Park. Med. shot: At Speaker's 
platform. JOHN is in front of the microphone 
trying to make himself heard over thousands 
of voices, all speaking at once.



                         Ladies and gentlemen! This is exactly 
what I came down here to tell you about 
tonight. Please, if you'll all just 
be quiet for a few minutes I can explain 
this whole thing to you. As you all 
know, this paper is published by a man 
by the name of D. B. Norton . . .


                         Med. shot: Shooting towards audience. 
Down an aisle stalks D. B., his hand 
waving in the air.



                         (shouting)

                         Don't listen to that man! He's a fake!


                         Camera pans with him as he hurries down 
the aisle to the platformall eyes turned 
toward him.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. As he stares at D. 
B. approaching, too flustered to know 
what to do.

                         Med. shot: Toward platform. As D. B. 
runs up the few steps and proceeds to 
the microphone, troopers clearing the 
way for him.



                         (drags John from mike)

                         Stand back!



                         Wait a minute! Everybody wait a minute! 
Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen! 
My name is D. B. Norton . . . you all 
know me! I accuse this man of being 
a faker! We've been taken for a lot 
of suckers! And I'm the biggest of the 
lot!



                         I spent a fortune backing this man in 
what I believed to be a sincere and 
worthy cause, just as you all did! And 
now I find out it's nothing but a cheap 
racket! Cooked up by him and two of 
my employees for the sole purpose of 
collecting dues from John Does all over 
the country!

                         JOHN breaks away from the troopers and 
gets to the mike.



                         That's a lie!



                         It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To 
stuff into their own pockets! You can 
read all about it in the newspapers 
there!



                         That's a lie! Listendon't believe what 
he says . . .



                         (overlapping above speech)

                         Let go of me! This man had no intention 
of jumping off of the top of a building! 
He was paid to say so!

                         (turning to John)

                         Do you deny that?



                         That's got nothing to do with it!



                         Were you paid for itor weren't you?




                         Yes! I was paid! But the



                         (over-lapping above speech)

                         And what about the suicide note? You 
didn't write that, either!



                         What difference does that make?



                         Did you write itor didn't you?



                         No, I didn't write it, but



                         Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You 
look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, 
and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed 
confession that she was the one that 
wrote it!



                         Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't 
write the letter, but this whole thing 
started





                         There! You see? He admits it! You're 
a fake, John Doe! And for what you've 
done to all these good peoplethey ought 
to run you out of the countryand I 
hope they do it!

                         He leaves the platformfollowed by his 
troopers.

                         Several shots: Of groups as they stare 
at JOHN, silent and stunned, waiting 
for him to speak.

                         Full shot: The whole park full of people 
wait in breathless anticipation. From 
somewhere in the distance we hear a 
single voice of a man.



                         Speak up, John! We believe you!

                         Med. shot: Under the platform. We see 
several of D. B.'s troopers pulling 
at the cables of the public address 
system.

                         Close shot: Of JOHN. He speaks into 
the microphone.



                         Please listen, folks! Now that he's 
through shooting off his face, I've 
got a couple of things to tell you about


                         Close shot: Under the platform. One 
of the troopers disconnects the public 
address system by cutting the cable.


                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He realizes the loud 
speaker is dead, and looks around helplessly.


                         Med. shot: Somewhere in audience TED 
SHELDON directs troopers.



                         Come on! The rest of you get in here 
and riot! Break this crowd up! Come 
on!

                         Med. shot: Of a group of John Does. 
They still stare uncertainly. Suddenly, 
the head of one of SHELDON's troopers 
appearand cupping his hands over his 
mouth, he yells toward platform.



                         John Doe's a fake! Boo! Boooooo!

                         Long shot: From ANNOUNCER's view. Shooting 
toward audience. The crowd is all yelling 
at once now.

                         Med. shot:



                         I'm sorry, folks, but we can't hear 
him any more. Something's gone wrong 
with the loudspeaker.

                         Med. shot: Of JOHN. Trying to talk over 
microphone.



                         Say, they can't hear me! The thing's 
not working!



                         (shouts)

                         Ladies and gentlemen! Lookthis thing's 
bigger than whether I'm a fake

                         (turns to BERT)

                         Look, Bert, you believe me, don't you?




                         (cynically)

                         Sure, I believe you. Walking my legs 
off digging up five thousand signatures 
for a phoney!

                         Suddenly, nervously, he begins tearing 
up the petition in his hand.



                         Well, there you are, Mr. Doe!

                         (flinging crumpled petition at him)


                         Five thousand names asking you not to 
jump off any roof!

                         He turns to leave.

                         Close shot: Of SOURPUSS, who, heartbroken, 
stops BERT.



                         It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's 
still good. We don't have to give up 
our club.



                         (harshly)

                         Yeah? Well, you can have it!

                         He exits.

                         Long shot: From ANNOUNCER's view. Crowd 
is yelling wildly.



                         They're starting to throw things!



                         Somebody's going to get hurt!

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He looks helplessly 
down at the hostile crowd.

                         Int. police station: Full shot: ANN 
and CONNELL are surrounded by several 
policemen. A sergeant sits at his desk, 
on which is a radio. ANN's face is haggard 
and desperate as she listens to the 
radio announcer.



                         I'm afraid it'll be John Doe. Listen 
to that mob!

                         Unable to stand it any longer, ANN suddenly 
jumps out of her seat.



                         I've got to go to him!



                         Sorry, ladyI can't let you out.





                         (sobbing)

                         Oh, let me go! Let me go to him! Oh, 
please, please let me go! They're crucifying 
him! I can help him!



                         Sorry, sister. We got orders to hold 
you.



                         Orders from who? Can't they see it's 
a frameup?

                         She is still desperately struggling 
to get freewhen her mother comes hurrying 
in.



                         Ann, darling!



                         Oh, Mother! They won't let me go! They 
won't let me go!

                         The police release her and she throws 
herself into her mother's arms.

                         Ext.: Ball park. Close shot: Of JOHN. 
He still attempts to get himself heard.




                         Listen, folks! You gotta listen to me, 
everybody!

                         Med. shot: Of a group of John Does.




                         (yelling toward JOHN)

                         Back to the jungle, you hobo!



                         (disgustedly)

                         Just another racket!



                         Stick to your clubs!



                         (shouting)

                         We've been fed baloney so long we're 
getting used to it!

                         Close shot: Of JOHN. He disregards the 
missiles that fly around his head.




                         (supplicatingly)

                         The idea is still good! Believe me, 
folks! . . .

                         Ext.: Ball park. Med. long shot: Toward 
platform. The crowd pushes menacingly 
around the platform, with policemen 
struggling to control them. JOHN still 
stands there, pathetic and helpless. 
Missiles of all kinds fly into the scene. 
The members of the band are scrambling 
off the platformas well as the others, 
until John is left alone.



                         Long shot: Shooting toward audience. 
They still boo and yell.

                         Med. shot: Of the COLONEL. Fearful for 
JOHN, he starts pushing his way through 
the crowd toward him.

                         Med. shot: Of a group of people. Suddenly 
a woman reaches into a lunch basket 
she carries and takes out a tomato.




                         (shouting)

                         You faker!

                         She reaches back to throw the tomato.


                         Close-up: Of JOHN. His voice is gone. 
His eyes are glassy. He is making one 
last effort to speak.



                         (hoarsely)

                         Listen . . . John Does . . .

                         (weakly)

                         You're the hope of the world . . .


                         As if in challenge to that statement, 
the tomato flies in and strikes him 
on the forehead. It seems to stun him. 
He remains motionless, staring before 
him with sightless eyes. The red smear 
of the tomato trickles down his face.


                         Med. shot: Of the COLONEL, amidst the 
crowd. He sees JOHN hit and winces. 
Then, setting his jaw, he pushes people 
violently aside, trying to reach JOHN.


                         Med. shot: On platform, JOHN stares 
futilely before him. The COLONEL reaches 
his side and glancing sympathetically 
up at his face, starts to lead him off 
the platform. A squadron of policemen 
also rush to his rescue and precede 
JOHN and the COLONEL.

                         Trucking shot: Down the aisleas police 
disperse the crowd who boo and threaten 
JOHN from the sidelines.

                         Close shot: Of JOHN. He is oblivious 
of the jeering, shouting moband of 
the wet newspapers flung in his direction.


                         Med. shot: At dug-out exitas the police 
finally manage to get him safely out 
of the park.

                         Med. shot: ANNOUNCER's booth.



                         The police finally manage to get him 
out of the park! If that boy isn't hurt, 
it'll be a miracle!

                         Int.: Police station. Med. shot: ANN 
and her mother sit on a bench. A policeman 
is in the background. ANN stares into 
space. Her mother has an arm around 
her.



                         Ladies and gentlemen, this certainly 
looks like the end of the John Doe movement.


                         A policeman snaps the radio off.





                         (lifts glass of milk)

                         Well, boys, you can chalk up another 
one to the Pontius Pilates.

                         Two shot: ANN and her mother.



                         (sobbing)

                         I should have been there. I could have 
helped him.

                         (desolately)

                         He was so all alone!

                         Her MOTHER draws ANN consolingly to 
her, and lays her head on her breast.

They both look depressed. After a silence, 
SOURPUSS speaks.



                         (throatily)

                         A lot of us are going to be mighty ashamed 
of ourselves after tonight. We certainly 
didn't give that man much of a chance.


                         They lapse again into silence. BERT 
stares grimly at the road.

                         Dissolve to: Ext.: Clearing under the 
bridge. Close-up: Of JOHN. He sits on 
a rock, his head bent low, tears streaming 
shamelessly down his cheeks. Camera 
draws back and we find the COLONEL before 
the fire, boiling water in a small tin 
pan.



                         Have some more coffee, Long John?



                         No, thanks, Colonel.

                         JOHN lifts his eyes skyward, stares 
profoundly, a curious expression over 
his face.

                         Dissolve to: A Montage. Long shot: Of 
JOHN, a lonely figure, walking dejectedly. 
As he walks, faces begin to appear one 
by one, to taunt him. Their accusing 
voices are heard.



                         Faker!



                         Racketeer!



                         Liar!

                         Why don't you jump!



                         Christmas Eve at midnight!

                         (she laughs, sneeringly)

                         Dissolve to: Another shot: Of JOHN walking, 
his expression immobile. Over the shot 
appear several scenes through which 
JOHN has lived:

                         1. BERT shaking hands with him, saying:




                         You're a wonderful man, Mr. Doe.

                         2. MRS. DELANEY kissing his hand and 
saying:



                         May God bless you, my boy.

                         3. ANN in Broadcasting Station, kissing 
him:



                         Now, get in there and pitch!

                         4. D. B. issuing his tirade at JOHN:




                         You're a fake, John Doe, and I can prove 
it! You're the big hero that's supposed 
to jump off tall buildings and things. 
You remember? What do you suppose your 
precious John Does will say when they 
find out that you never had any intention 
of doing itthat you were being paid 
to say so?

                         5. Again the girl who laughed appears:




                         Christmas Eve at midnight?

                         And again she laughs sneeringly.

Long shot: It is a picturesque scene 
of the City Hall outlined in silhouette 
against the sky. A peaceful mantle of 
snow silently descends upon it. Over 
the shot we hear the plaintive voices 
of children singing "Holy Night."


                         Dissolve to: Ext.: Outside of D. B.'s 
house: Med. shot: Outside D. B.'s Studythrough 
window. A group of eight young carolers 
sing "Holy Night." It is a continuation 
of the music from previous scene.


                         Cut to: Int. D. B.'s study. Med. shot: 
In the dimly lit room, we see the lonely 
figure of D. B., as he stands near a 
window staring out, meditatively. The 
voices of the children singing Christmas 
carols are faintly heard.



                         Close-up: Of D. B. He peers into the 
night, enveloped by disturbing thoughts. 
After a moment, he takes out his watch 
and glances at it. Then, as if annoyed 
by his own apprehension, he shoves it 
violently back into his pocket.

                         Camera retreats in front of him as he 
crosses, determinedly, to a humidor, 
takes a cigar and shoves it into his 
mouth. Just as he is about to light 
it, he becomes aware of the signing, 
and cocks his head, listening.

                         Wider shot: As he drops the match and 
the unlighted cigarand starts toward 
door. Just then the BUTLER comes through.




                         Merry Christmas, sir.



                         Oh. Merry Christmas.

                         D. B. hands him a bill and nods toward 
the children. The BUTLER exits.

                         Close-up: Of D. B. Staring out into 
space moodily. We hear the voices of 
the children saying, "Thank you, sir! 
Merry Christmas!" D. B.'s mouth screws 
up, unhappily. It is far from a "merry" 
Christmas. It is a very lonely, conscience-stricken 
one.

                         Dissolve to: Int.: Police station. Med. 
shot: A SERGEANT sits in front of his 
desk. Opposite him is a POLICEMAN. Their 
rummy game has been interrupted by a 
phone call which the SERGEANT is now 
answering.



                         Who? John Doe? Is that screwball still 
around?

                         (laughing)



                         (with disgust)

                         Aw, that dame's been callin' all day.




                         Sure, sure, I know. Yeah. At midnight,

by her side and her mother at the foot 
of the bed. They watch herconcerned.




                         Ohthey're laughing at me!

                         Impulsively, ANN picks up the receiver 
and starts dialing again.



                         You're a sick girl, Ann. You'd better 
take it easy.





                         Whom are you calling now? You called 
that number not ten minutes ago!

CONNELL speaks into the phone.

                         She hangs up the receiver, despairingly. 
Then, suddenly, she jumps out of bed 
and runs to a clothes closetgrabbing 
a coat and scarf.

                         Yeah? Well, if he is, I'm a banana split!




                         That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't 
ask me how I know. I just know. And 
you know it as well as I do.



                         Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy 
tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna 
jump off any roof.



                         I don't think he was any fakenot with 
that face. And, anyway, what he stood 
for wasn't a fake.





                         Okay, honey, okay.

                         Cut to: Int: Main floor corridor, City 
Hall. Full shot: It is vast and empty, 
except for a colored porter, scrubbing.


                         Med. shot: At entrance. As ANN enters 
from outside. Determinedly, she starts 
toward elevators.

                         Close shot: At elevator. ANN pushes 
button impatiently. She feels weak, 
and has to brace herself to stay on 
her feet. Suddenly, she is startled 
by the COLONEL'S voice.



                         Elevators ain't running.

                         Camera pans over to the COLONEL, who 
sits on the stairs, next to the elevator.


                         Med. shot: ANN walks over to him, her 
face lighting up hopefully.



                         Colonel!



                         You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, 
Miss.



                         Has he been here?



                         No.



                         Have you seen him?



                         (sadly)

                         I ain't seen him for a week.



                         Where's Connell?



                         He's watching the other door.



                         Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.

                         ANN stares at him a moment, then, impulsively, 
she starts to pass him to go up the 
stairs.



                         (grabs her)

                         No sense in going up there! I been here 
for hours. He ain't here!



                         (pulls away from him)

                         Oh, let me go, will you!





                         (calling after her)

                         Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!


                         But ANN vanishes. The COLONEL shakes 
his head and resumes his post.

                         Med. shot: At entrance. As the MAYOR, 
followed by D. B., HAMMETT, and the 
others, enters. Camera pans with them 
as they go toward the elevator.

                         Med. shot: They arrive at the elevator. 
The MAYOR takes out his keys and unlocks 
the elevator door.

                         Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He watches 
them, puzzled. Can't figure out what 
they are doing here.

                         Cut to: Insert: Of elevator dialas 
the light flicks on to number 14, indicating 
14th floor. Camera pans down to elevator 
door, which opens and the men come out.




                         This is as far as the elevator goes. 
We've got to walk up to the tower.


                         He indicates the stairway.

                         Cut to: Wider shot: As they cross to 
stairway, silently.

                         Dissolve to: Ext.: City Hall roof. Full 
shot: The men enter. They glance around 
searchinglyand then slowly move toward 
the edge of the parapet.

                         Closer shot: The men look obviously 
self-conscious. No one speaks for a 
while.



                         (breaking the silence)

                         That tramp is probably full of Christmas 
cheer and asleep in some flop house.


                         There is again silence. After a few 
minutes, the MAYOR speaks.



                         Let's go. I've got to decorate my tree.


                         Cut to: Int.: Corridor14th floor. Med. 
shot: Outside Men's Washroom. JOHN comes 
out, and as camera pans with him he 
proceeds to letter chute next to elevator. 
We see that it is the top of the chute, 
and from the elevator being there, we 
know it is the 14th floor. JOHN drops 
the letter into the chute.

                         Ext.: City Hall roof. Full shot: The 
place is silent except for occasional 
scraping of feet as several of the men 
move around. They continually refer 
to their watches. Finally, D. B. gives 
up impatiently.



                         Well, I give up. I don't know what gave 
us the idea that hehe'd attempt anything 
like this.



                         I guess you're right. I'm afraid the 
joke's on us. Let's go.





                         I hope nobody finds out we've been here.


                         They all start to exit, when suddenly 
D. B. stops. He puts his hand out, and 
they all stop to listen. They hear footsteps, 
and back into the shadows.

                         Med. shot: Shooting toward stairs. JOHN 
appears around the bend and mounts the 
last few steps.

                         Med. shot: Of the huddled group. They 
watch breathlessly. In the darkness, 
their eyes dominate the scene.

                         Med. shot: Over their shoulders. As 
JOHN, expressionless, his cigarette 
in his hand, crosses to the parapet, 
and looks out. He takes a puff of his 
cigarette and exhales the smoke.

                         Med. shot: Of the huddled group. The 
MAYOR is for stepping forward, but D. 
B. with an extended hand stops him, 
indicating for them to wait and see 
what happens.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He takes the envelope 
out of his pocket and examines it.


                         Close shot: Of the group. Their eyes 
glued on him tensely.

                         Close shot: Of JOHN. He stares at the 
envelope.

                         Insert: Of envelope. On it is written: 
                         "TO JOHN DOES EVERYWHERE".

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He replaces the envelope 
in his pocket.

                         Int.: Tower. Close shot: The group. 
Their eyes riveted on JOHN. They feel 
the moment has come. Several of them 
glance toward D. B.

                         Wider shot: To include them all, and 
JOHN. He drops his cigarette on the 
ground, and bending over, crushes it 
with his foot. Just as he straightens 
out again, D. B. speaks.



                         (restrained voice)

                         I wouldn't do that if I were you, John.


                         Close-up: Of JOHN. As he turns sharply, 
startled. He stares blankly at the five 
people.

                         Med. shot: Of the group. They move slightly 
forward and stop.



                         It'll do you no good.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He continues to stare 
at them, strangely.

                         Wider shot: To include them all.



                         The Mayor has policemen downstairs with 
instructions to remove all marks of 
identification you may have on your 
person. You'll be buried in Potter's 
Field[12] and you will have accomplished 
nothing.

                         Close shot: Of JOHN. After a moment, 
he speaks.





                         (in a sepulchral voice)

                         I've taken care of that. I've already 
mailed a copy of this letter to Mr. 
Connell.

                         Med. shot: Of the group. Amazed that 
he thought of this. They feel themselves 
helpless. D. B. tries taking an authoritative 
tone.



                         (his throat is dry)

                         John, why don't you forget this foolishness?


                         He steps forward as he speaks.



                         (quicklythreateningly)

                         Stop right where you are, Mr. Norton, 
if you don't want to go overboard with 
me.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN's face. His eyes have 
a wild, maniacal look in them.

                         Close-up: Of D. B. He stares into JOHN's 
eyes and a terrified expression covers 
his face.

                         Wider shot: As D. B. instinctively backs 
up.



                         (throatily)

                         I'm glad you gentlemen are here. You've 
killed the John Doe movement, all right, 
but you're going to see it born all 
over again. Now, take a good look, Mr. 
Norton.

                         Int.: Landing to tower. Med. shot: As 
ANN practically has to pull herself 
up to the last step. Her face is wet 
from fever and exhaustion.



                         (an outcry)

                         John!

                         Int.: Tower. Full shot: As everyone, 
startled by the outcry, turns. ANN staggers 
into scene.



                         (crying)

                         John!

                         She rushes and throws her arms around 
him.



                         (muffled sobs)

                         Oh, John, darling. No! No!

                         Close shot: JOHN and ANN. He stares 
down at her, blankly. ANN clutches him, 
her head buried in his shoulder.



                         (muffled sobs)

                         I won't let you. I love you, darling.




                         Med. shot: Of the group. They remain 
motionless, watching.

                         Close shot: JOHN and ANN. She emits 
wracking sobs, then lifts her eyes up 
to him.



                         (in a desperate plea)

                         John. Please, John, listen to me. We'll 
start all over again, just you and I. 
It isn't too late. The John Doe movement 
isn't dead yet.

                         Suddenly she becomes conscious of the 
others present, and she turns her head.


                         Camera pans over to what she sees. The 
group of men watching, silently.

                         Camera pans back to ANN. Her eyes widen 
slowly. She looks from them to JOHN 
and back again, and her face takes on 
an excited, breathless look, as the 
reason for their being there becomes 
comprehensible to her.



                         (excitedly)

                         See, John! It isn't dead, or they wouldn't 
be here! It's alive in them . They kept 
it alive. By being afraid of it. That's 
why they came up here.

                         Close shot: ANN and JOHN. He continues 
to stand with his hands at his sides, 
looking at her, while she clings to 
him desperately. While she speaks, he 
turns his face from her and stares at 
the men.



                         Oh, darling. Sure, it should have been 
killed before. It was dishonest.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He is staring strangely 
at the group of menas slowly, gradually, 
the curtain is being lifted from his 
clouded brain.



                         But we can start clean now. Just you 
and I. It'll grow again, John. It'll 
grow big. And it'll be strong, because 
it'll be honest!

                         Close-up: Of ANN. Her strength is fast 
ebbing away. She clings to JOHN more 
tenaciously.



                         (last bit of effort)

                         Oh, darling, if it's worth dying for, 
it's worth living for. Oh, please, John 
                         . . .

                         She looks up at his face, seeking some 
sign of his relenting-but she finds 
none.

                         Close-up: Of ANN, who still clinging 
to him, lays her cheek on his chestand 
lifts her eyes heavenward.



                         (a murmured prayer)

                         Oh, please, Godhelp me!



                         Flash: Of the menas they stare transfixed, 
waiting breathlessly.

                         Med. shot: At entrance. BERT, SOURPUSS 
and others appearhaving run up the 
stairs breathlessly. Their eyes are 
filled with apprehension. CONNELL and 
the COLONEL are with them. When they 
see the scene before them, they stop, 
awed.

                         Close-up: Of ANN. Suddenly she stares 
before heras a divine inspiration comes 
to her. Her eyes light up with a wide, 
ecstatic fire.

                         Two shot: ANN and JOHN. ANN turns and 
glances up at JOHN's face.



                         (tensely)

                         John!

                         She takes his face in her two hands 
and turns it to her.



                         John, look at me. You want to be honest, 
don't you? Well, you don't have to die 
to keep the John Doe idea alive! Someone 
already died for that once! The first 
John Doe. And He's kept that idea alive 
for nearly two thousand years.

                         Close shot: BERT, his WIFE and SOURPUSS. 
The cynical expression on BERT's face 
begins to soften.



                         (with sincere conviction)

                         It was He who kept it alive in them 
and He'll go on keeping it alive for 
ever and always! For every John Doe 
movement these men kill, a new one will 
be born!

                         Two shot: ANN and JOHN. JOHN remains 
grimly unmoved. ANN continues.



                         (ecstatically)

                         That's why those bells are ringing, 
John! They're calling to usnot to give 
upbut to keep on fighting! To keep 
on pitching! Oh, don't you see, darling? 
This is no time to give up!

                         Several flashes: To intercut with ANN's 
speechone of BERT; his WIFE; CONNELL; 
                         D. B.

                         Med. shot: Toward ANN and JOHN. ANN's 
strength is slowly waning.



                         You and I, John, we can

                         (suddenly)

                         No, John, if you die, I want to die, 
too!

                         (weakly)

                         Oh, I love you so

                         Her strength leaves herand as her eyelids 
slowly shut, she collapses limply in 
his arms.

                         Med. shot: Of BERT's group, as they 
react to this. BERT stares, profoundly 
moved.



                         Med. shot: JOHN and ANNas he stares 
bewildered, at ANN at his feet. Mechanically, 
he reaches down and lifts her in his 
arms.



                         Mr. Doe . . .

                         JOHN vaguely becomes aware of BERT's 
presence and glances toward him.

                         Med. shot: BERT, his WIFE and SOURPUSS.




                         (his voice chokedhaltingly)

                         You don't have toWhy, we're with you, 
Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and 
acted like a mob. Why, we . . .



                         (jumping in)

                         What Bert's trying to say iswellwe 
need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot 
of us didn't believe what that man said.


                         Close-up: Of JOHNas he listens to her, 
expressionless.



                         We were going to start up our John Doe 
Club again whether we saw you or not.


                         Med. shot: BERT, his WIFE and SOURPUSS.




                         Weren't we, Bert?

                         BERT nods.



                         And there were a lot of others that 
were going to do the same thing. Why, 
Mr. Sourpuss even got a letter from 
his cousin in Toledo, and . . .



                         (joiningeagerly)

                         Yeah, I got it right here, Mr. Doe!


                         Close-up: Of JOHN. The bewildered look 
in his eyes has vanished. It is now 
replaced by an expression of softness 
and understanding.



                         (choked)

                         Onlyonly it'll be a lot easier with 
you. Pleaseplease come with us, Mr. 
Doe!

                         JOHN remains standing, thoughtful.


                         Med. shot: Of BERT's group. They all 
look supplicatingly at him.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He stares at BERT's 
group and, shifting his gaze, looks 
at D. B. and his crowd. Then, turning 
back to BERT, his eyes light up and 
something of a warm smile appears on 
his face.

                         Full shot: As JOHN, having decided on 
his course, starts forward with ANN 
in his arms. The church bells chime 
loud and victoriously.



                         Med. shot: Around BERT. Their eyes brighten 
ecstatically as JOHN walks toward them. 
They all speak at once.



                         (ad-lib)

                         Mr. Doe!

                         She'll be all right!

                         We've got a car downstairs . . .

                         They follow JOHN out, chattering excitedly. 
Only CONNELL and the COLONEL remain.
