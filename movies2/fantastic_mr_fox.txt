          EXT. WOODS. DAY

An apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill. A handsome
fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans
against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed, chewing
on a reed of wild grass. He holds an apple core in his paw.
He spits out a seed. He looks off across a meadow that
descends into the valley below.
A female fox strides briskly up the hill. Her coat is a
paler, especially beautiful shade of fox-red, and she wears
men's trousers and a dark tunic. Fox says as she approaches:

                         FOX
          What'd the doctor say?

          MRS. FOX
          Nothing. Supposedly, it's just a twenty-
four hour bug. He gave me some pills.

                         FOX

                         (REASSURINGLY)
          I told you. You probably just ate some
bad gristle.
Fox brushes the fur on Mrs. Fox's ears with his paws. They
walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the
path. Fox points:

                         FOX
          Should we take the short cut or the
scenic route?

          MRS. FOX
          Let's take the short cut.

                         FOX
          But the scenic route is so much prettier.

          MRS. FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          OK, let's take the scenic route.

                         FOX
          Great. It's actually slightly quicker,
anyway.
Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a
quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her
waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off
down the scenic route.









          2.

          EXT. FARM. DAY

A rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn, a tin silo, and
a rickity windmill. There is a sheep in a little pasture. A
sign on a rail says Berkus Squab. Fox and Mrs. Fox watch from
the bushes outside a fence.

          MRS. FOX
          What is a squab?

                         FOX
          You know what a squab is. It's like a
pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of
bird we can eat.
Fox motions toward the edge of the property.

                         FOX
          Should we go through the hole under the
horse fence or climb the rail over the
bridle path?

          MRS. FOX
          Well, I guess the horse fence would be a
little safer.

                         FOX
          But the bridle path puts us out right
next to the squab shack.
Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods
nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny.

                         FOX
          What's wrong? I've never seen you like
this. You're acting all skittish. Don't
worry. I've been stealing birds for a
living since before I could trot.

          MRS. FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          OK, let's take the --

                         FOX
          No, we'll do the horse fence. You gave me
the scenic route already.
Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly:

                         FOX
          By the way, you look unbelievably
beautiful tonight. You're practically
glowing. Maybe it's the lighting.









          3.
          Mrs. Fox is, in fact, glowing, albeit ever so slightly. She
stares at Fox enigmatically. Fox touches his paw to her
cheek.
(NOTE: an alternate version of Mrs. Fox will be used for this
shot which can be literally lit from within.)
With the speed, grace, and precision of athletes, Fox and
Mrs. Fox: dart through a hole under a painted fence; race
along a thin trail next to a garage; crawl beneath a window
where a blonde woman serves an early dinner, dealing
hamburgers like playing cards to three little, blond
children; creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever
sleeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes; and
shimmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond,
bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet, completely
pulverizing it into sawdust. They arrive in front of a wooden
shed. Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a
rapid reverse-flip with a flourish.
Fox lifts a loose board. He looks to Mrs. Fox and puts his
finger to his lips for her to be quiet. She shrugs
impatiently. They duck inside.
They come back out. Each holds a dead, bloody pigeon in
his/her teeth. They start to run away. Fox looks up above
them. He stops. He frowns. He takes the pigeon out of his
mouth and says curiously, pointing toward the sky:

                         FOX
          What's that? I think that's a fox-trap!
Look at this.

          MRS. FOX
          Get away from there.

                         FOX
          Is it spring-loaded? Yeah...
(pointing to different spots)
I guess if you come from over there, and
you're standing at the door to the squab
shack, this little gadget probably
triggers the --
(gesturing to Mrs. Fox)
Move out of the way, darling. That's
right where it's going to land.
Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm.

          MRS. FOX
          Come on! Stop it! Let's go!









          4.
          Fox pulls on a little, hanging wire. A chain unrolls rapidly
from a pulley, and a steel cage falls slap down on top of
them. A small tag on the base of it says Badoit et Fils. Fox
and Mrs. Fox stand motionless, side by side, in disbelief.

                         FOX
          No, it just falls straight down right
here, doesn't it? I guess it's not spring-
loaded.
Sounds come from around the farm: the dog barks, doors open,
voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox turns to Fox and says

                         QUIETLY:

          MRS. FOX
          I'm pregnant.
Fox stares at Mrs. Fox. He is confused but moved.

                         FOX
          Wow. We're going to have a cub. Honey,
that's great news!

          MRS. FOX
          If we're still alive tomorrow morning, I
want you to find another line of work.
Pause. Fox nods.

                         CUT TO:
          A wide shot of the entire valley. There are thick woods,
green and yellow fields, two ponds, a small village, and a
river running through the middle.

                         TITLE:
          2 YEARS LATER ( 12 Fox-Years)

          EXT. HOLE. DAY

The entrance to a tunnel under a dirt mound covered with
holly bushes.

          INT. HOLE. DAY

A small, comfortable kitchen off a living room with two
bedrooms behind it. Fox sits at the kitchen table reading a
newspaper called the Gazette. His fur has gone grey at the
temples, and he now wears a dark, double-breasted, pin-
striped suit with a conservative necktie. Mrs. Fox stands at
the counter-top stirring something in a bowl with a whisk.









          5.
          She is dressed in a paint-splattered, cream-colored,
Victorian-style dress.

                         INSERT:
          A column in the newspaper with Fox's picture at the top of
it. The caption reads: Fox about Town with Fantastic Mr. Fox.

                         FOX
          Does anybody actually read my column? Do
your friends ever talk about it?

          MRS. FOX

                         (STILL STIRRING)
          Of course. In fact, Rabbit's ex-
girlfriend just said to me last week, "I
should read Foxy's column," but they
don't get the Gazette.
(yelling into the next room)
Ash! Let's get cracking!

                         FOX
          Why would they? It's a rag-sheet.

                         (SIGHS)
          I want to say I hate my job, but that
would make it seem more important to me
than I want people to think it is.
Mrs. Fox puts down her bowl and starts slicing a loaf of
bread. A small, narrow fox cub comes out of one of the
bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt. His hair is
smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong. He is Ash.

                         ASH
          I'm sick.

          MRS. FOX
          You're not sick.

                         ASH
          I have a temperature.
Mrs. Fox goes quickly over to Ash and puts her paw to his
forehead.

          MRS. FOX
          You don't have a temperature.
Ash turns away and says as he goes back into his bedroom:

                         ASH
          I don't want to go.









          6.

          MRS. FOX
          Hurry up. You're going to be late.
Mrs. Fox goes back into the kitchen and starts making toast
and coffee. Fox whispers to her:

                         FOX
          I love the way you handled that.
Mrs. Fox looks at Fox sideways. She says loudly to Ash:

          MRS. FOX
          Your cousin Kristofferson's coming first
thing tomorrow morning. I want you to be
extra nice to him, because he's going
through a very hard time right now, OK?
Ash comes back out of his bedroom. He now wears a white
cardigan and white socks with his white pants tucked into
them. He says aggressively:

                         ASH
          Where's he going to sleep?

          MRS. FOX
          We're going to make a bed for him in your
room tonight.

                         ASH
          I can't spare the space. Put him in Dad's
study.
Fox says without looking up from his newspaper:

                         FOX
          Dad's study is occupied by Dad.
Ash goes back into his bedroom. Fox lowers his newspaper. He
looks around the room. He says to Mrs. Fox:

                         FOX
          I don't want to live in a hole anymore.
It makes me feel poor.
Mrs. Fox stops buttering the toast. She looks to Fox and says

                         SOFTLY:

          MRS. FOX
          We are poor -- but we're happy.
Fox twists his paw in the air, indicating:









          7.

                         FOX
          Comme-ci, comme-ga. Anyway, the views are
better above ground.
Mrs. Fox nods. She brings Fox a plate of toast and a cup of
coffee. Fox takes her paw and says:

                         FOX
          I'm seven non-fox-years old now. My
father died at seven and a half. I don't
want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm
going to do something about it.
Fox kisses Mrs. Fox's paw. He suddenly eats three slices of
toast in a second and a half, savagely but neatly. He stands
and picks up his cup of coffee.

                         FOX
          Well, I'm off.
Fox throws back the last of his coffee, kisses Mrs. Fox on
the back of her neck, grabs his briefcase, tucks his
newspaper under his arm, and walks to the door. He shouts

                         CHEERILY:

                         FOX
          Have a good day, my darlings!
Ash comes out the bedroom again. He has now added a white
cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his
teeth. There is toothpaste all over his mouth. He waves
briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom. Fox looks
puzzled.

                         FOX
          What's he wearing?
Mrs. Fox shrugs. She smiles sadly and waves to Fox. Fox waves
back. He starts to go out but pauses to look down at a folded
up section of his newspaper.

                         INSERT:
          A clipping from the real estate section. There is a
photograph of a wide, sprawling beech tree at the top of a
hill. A caption below it reads:
Tree Living, Great Views, Classic Beech

          INT. TREE. DAY

A door opens into a wide, low space with peeling paint. There
is an old chair against the wall, a bare light bulb hanging









          8.
          from the ceiling, and a layer of dust over everything. A
skinny weasel in a khaki outfit immediately starts in as Fox
comes into the living room:

                         WEASEL
          Obviously, it's first growth, indigenous.
Original dirt floor, good bark, skipping
stone hearth --
Weasel is interrupted by a loud banging clank. He and Fox
peer into the next room. A heavy-set opossum with a cowlick
tinkers with some pipes under the kitchen sink. He is Kylie.
Weasel snaps at him:

                         WEASEL
          What'd I tell you? I'm showing the
property. You're not supposed to be here.

                         KYLIE
          (checking his watch)
Oh, cuss. What time is it? I'm sorry.
Weasel sighs. He waves his arm in Kylie's direction and says
distractedly, slightly annoyed:

                          WEASEL
           This is Kylie. He's the super.
(aside to Fix)
He's a little --
Weasel makes a fluttering gesture with his paw. Fox nods. He
points at a bucket on the floor next to Kylie among bolts,
tools, and washers.

                         FOX
          What's in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?

                         KYLIE

                         (HESITATES)
          Just minnows. You want one?

                         FOX
          Certainly. Thank you.
Kylie reaches into his bucket and hands Fox a live, wriggling
minnow. Fox swallows it whole.
Fox stares out the window at three sprawling poultry
compounds in the distance. Black smoke pours out of a
farmhouse chimney on each property. A sign on a water tower
in the first compound reads Boggis Farms and has a picture of
a chicken on it. A sign on a silo in the second compound
reads Bunce Industries and has a picture of a goose on it. A
sign on a windmill in the third compound reads Bean, inc.









          9.
          (since 1976) and has a picture of a turkey with an apple on
it.
Weasel says pointedly from across the room:

                         WEASEL
          May I ask what you do for a living, Mr.
Fox?
Fox's eyes narrow as he looks out, entranced, with his mouth
slightly open. He says almost inaudibly:

                         FOX
          I used to steal birds, but now I'm a
newspaper man.

                         WEASEL

                         (PLEASED)
          Oh, sure. I've seen your by-line.
Fox snaps out of his reverie and says suddenly:

                         FOX
          Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Fox shakes hands abruptly with Weasel and starts across the
room. Weasel is about to ask something when Fox stops in the
doorway, looks back, and says:

                         FOX
          Oh, and Kylie -- thank you for the
minnow. It was superb.
Kylie smiles. Fox exits.

          EXT. RIVER. DAY

A beaver dam across a bend in a fast stream. A still pond
sits above it. There is an entrance tunnel tucked beneath a
rock.

          INT. BEAVER DAM. DAY

A large room of twig, stick, and mud construction. A card on
the door reads Badger, Beaver, and Stoat, L.L.P, Attorneys at
Law. An anxious badger sits at his desk reviewing some
documents. Fox paces the floor with his hands clasped behind
his back.

                         BADGER
          Don't buy this tree, Foxy. You're

species.

          You're exaggerating, Badger.

                         BADGER

                         (YELLING)
          Bull-cuss! I'm sugar-coating it, man!
This is Boggis, Bunce, and Bean! Three of
the meanest, nastiest, ugliest farmers in
the history of this valley!
An uneasy otter secretary peers in at them from the outer
office. Fox looks intrigued.

                         FOX
          Really? Tell me about them.
Silence. Badger sighs. He loosens his tie and settles in.

                         BADGER
          All right...

                         CUT TO:
          A fat man with a huge moustache. He wears a tweed suit which
stretches at the buttons so much that they look like they are
about to snap off. He holds a carbine rifle. He stands in
front of his farm, which contains row upon row of chicken
houses. He has an ugly face. He is Boggis.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          Walter Boggis is a chicken farmer.
Probably the most successful in the
world.

          INT. BOGGIS' KITCHEN. DAY

Boggis sits at a chopping block tearing into a boiled chicken
with a fork and a meat cleaver.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's unbelievably fat -- which maybe is
genetic -- but he also eats three boiled
chickens smothered with dumplings every
day for breakfast, lunch, supper, and
dessert. That's twelve in total, per
diem.

                         INSERT:









          11.
          Boggis' ear. Furry black and white hairs grow out of it. A
fly buzzes around, lands on it, and crawls inside. Boggis
sticks his pinky in after it and scratches.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He never takes a bath, as a result of
which his ear holes are clogged with all
kinds of muck and wax and bits of chewing
gum and dead flies and so on.

                         CUT TO:
          A short, overweight man with one slightly wandering eye. He
wears overalls and a cap. He holds a twelve-gauge shotgun. He
stands in front of his farm, which consists of several long
buildings in rows like a factory. He has a nasty face. He is
Bunce.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          Nathan Bunce is a duck and goosefarmer.
He owns about 2 million ducksand 500,000
geese. You might say he's kind ofa pot-
bellied dwarf of some kind.

          EXT. SWIMMING POOL. DAY

Bunce stands up to his nose in water. The depth reads 4FT.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's so short his chin would probably be
under water in the shallow end of any
swimming pool on the planet.

          INT. BUNCE'S KITCHEN. DAY

Bunce sits on two stacked telephone books on a chair. He guts
a dead goose, cutting out its liver and mashing it with a
fork. A plate of doughnuts cools on the table.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He eats only doughnuts with smashed-up
goose livers injected into them.

                         CUT TO:
          A tall, skinny man in a long trench-coat. He holds a Luger
pistol. He stands in front of his farm, which is an apple
orchard that stretches over thousands of acres. He has a mean
face. He is Bean.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          Franklin Bean is a turkey and apple
farmer. He keeps his birds in an orchard

run about among the trees.

          INT. BEAN'S SHED. DAY

Bean works at a moonshine-type cider still, boiling chemicals
and sipping from a bottle.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's probably anorexic, because he never
eats anything. He's on a liquid diet of
strong, alcoholic cider, which he makes
from his apples. He's as skinny as a
pencil, as smart as a whip -- and easily
the biggest cusshole I've ever met in my
life.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Badger in Badger's office.

                         BADGER
          In summation, I think you just got to not
do it, man. That's all.

                         FOX
          I understand what you're saying, and your
comments are valuable, but I'm going to
ignore your advice.
Badger leaps out of his chair and slams the office door. He
points his finger at Fox and screams:

                         BADGER
          The cuss you are!

          The cuss am I?
Fox jumps up and points back at Badger, screaming:

          Don't cussing point at me!

                         (SCREAMING)
          Do I look like I'm cussing with you?
Fox and Badger begin to snarl and snap savagely, knocking
into the furniture as they circle around the room pointing in
each other's faces. Suddenly, they calm down all at once,
sighing deeply. Pause.

                         FOX
          One last thing: something's probably
about to happen to me at work which I
can't put my finger on but have a funny
feeling about. How can I protect myself
legally?

                         BADGER

                         (PAUSE)
          Are you about to get fired?

                         FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          Slash quit.

                         CUT TO:
          A door with a frosted glass window. Letters painted on it
read Gazette, Editor-in-Chief, Phillip Squirrel. Fox's
silhouette stands across from that of a small squirrel
sitting at a desk. The squirrel's silhouette says in a

                         GRAVELLY VOICE:

                         SQUIRREL
          You're fired.

                         FOX
          Slash I quit. Here's my letter of
resignation.
Fox's silhouette throws an envelope onto the squirrel's desk.

                         MONTAGE:
          Two muskrats in orange moving company uniforms unloads boxes
and furniture from a wagon and carries them into the tree.
Fox holds open the front door and barks orders at them.
Two muskrats in white painter's uniforms paints the walls of
the living room and the trim around the windows with rollers
and brushes. Fox stands on the drop-cloth and barks orders at
them.









          14.
          Two muskrats in blue electrician's uniforms work in the
kitchen. Mrs. Fox watches over their shoulders and barks
orders at them.
Fox holds up a pair of flowered curtains in front of a
window. He looks to Mrs. Fox. She stares at the curtains
thoughtfully. She raises an eyebrow.
Fox and Mrs. Fox sit in the windowsill looking out at the
sunset. Ash stands in-between them. The flowered curtains
wave in the breeze. Fox puffs on a pipe. Ash blows a soap
bubble. Mrs. Fox puts out her paw and a butterfly lands on
it. She smiles at Fox. He puts his arm around her. He raises
a pair of binoculars to his eyes.

                         INSERT:
          A binocular shot of an industrial shack with Boggis Chicken
House #1 stencilled on the front of it.
Fox lowers the binoculars. His eyes sparkle.

          EXT. TREE. DAY

Ash stands poised on a high branch over an inflatable
swimming pool printed with a red-tartan plaid pattern. He
wears over-sized swim trunks with a pattern of acorns printed
on them. Fox sits in the grass eating an apple below with
Mrs. Fox. She is painting at an easel. Ash yells:

                         ASH
          Watch this, Dad!
Fox looks up. Ash leaps into the air and does a spectacularly
awkward back-flip during which he appears to have four arms
and three legs randomly attached to his body, flailing
wildly. He hits the water by the side of his head and smacks
into the surface back-first with a pained yelp. Fox grimaces.
He claps mildly.
(NOTE: an alternate version of Ash with four arms and three
legs randomly attached to his body will be used for this
stunt.)

                         FOX
          Good jump, Ash! Remember to keep your
tail tucked!
Fox looks at Mrs. Fox's canvas. It is a picture of the pond
and landscape in severe weather with black clouds and
lightning bolts. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox raises an
eyebrow.









          15.

                         FOX
          Still painting thunderstorms, I see.
Fox sees a small, Samsonite suitcase on the ground next to a
pair of yellow sneakers. He frowns.

                         FOX
          Whose suitcase is that?
A boy's voice shouts from the high tree branch:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Hello, everyone! Good afternoon!
Fox, Mrs. Fox, and Ash look up, surprised. A second Fox cub
stands poised on the edge of the limb. He is taller, leaner,
sleeker, and it is immediately apparent even by his posture
infinitely more graceful than Ash. He is Kristofferson. He
wears a professional Speedo with a patch on it that says Swim
Team. Fox brightens.

                         FOX
          Kristofferson! Welcome to our little
tree! I see you brought your swimming
trunks!
Kristofferson steps off the branch and performs a reserved
but perfect jack-knife. He enters the water splashlessly. Fox
leaps to his feet, applauding with his paws above his head,
whistling and hollering:

                         FOX
          Look at that! This kid's a natural! I'm
speechless, Kristofferson!
Kristofferson smiles modestly and shrugs. Ash stares at him
stonily. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox.

                         FOX
          Plus, he knows karate.

          INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING

Fox sits in his armchair reading the Gazette. Ash sits on a
braided rug on the floor beside him reading a comic book
called The Adventures of White Cape. On the cover, there is a
picture of a ferret leaping off a motorcycle. Mrs. Fox is in
the kitchen in the background flattening a hunk of dough with
a rolling pin. Kristofferson is in the next room practicing
tae-kwon-do. He wears khaki shorts, yellow sneakers, and a
blue, short-sleeved, button-down shirt.









          16.

                         ASH
          Do you think I'm an athlete?

                         FOX
          (without looking up)
What are you talking about?

                         ASH
          Well, you know, I think I'm an athlete,
and sometimes I feel like you guys don't
see me that way.

                         FOX
          What's the sub-text here?
Ash thinks for a minute. He looks at Kristofferson in the
next room. Kristofferson is now sitting Indian-style on the
floor meditating. His paws are turned upward with his thumbs
touching his index fingers forming a ring. Ash says loudly to
Mrs. Fox in the kitchen:

                         ASH
          How long is Kristofferson supposed to
stay with us?

          MRS. FOX
          Until your uncle gets better.

                         ASH
          Right, but roughly how long do we plan to
give him on that? Double-pneumonia isn't
even really that big of a deal, is it?
In the background, Kristofferson stands up again and starts
practicing violent karate kicks. Mrs. Fox leans into the
doorway and whispers forcefully:

          MRS. FOX
          As a matter of fact, it is. He's lucky to
be alive. Now --

                         ASH
          Right, but --
Kristofferson yells suddenly as he does a spinning double-
kick with a chop:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Ki-ya!
Everyone looks startled. Kristofferson resumes his tae-kwon-
do practice with an angry, wounded look on his face. Mrs. Fox

                         SAYS COLDLY:









          17.

          MRS. FOX
          Lower your voice, Ash.

          EXT. TREE. NIGHT

Fox and Kylie sit in a porch swing on one of the middle
branches of Fox's tree. They drink cups of coffee. Crickets
chirp.

                         FOX
          Kids are crazy, aren't they? You got to
try it, though. Raising a family.

                         KYLIE
          Yeah. Sometimes I feel like maybe I

                         MIGHT --

                         FOX
          What do you think of this tree, by the
way? It's great, huh?

                         KYLIE

                         (HESITATES)
          Yeah. No, I was just saying how some-

                         TIMES --

                         FOX
          I have one last part of what I was about
to say.

                         KYLIE
          OK. Go ahead.

                         FOX
          I'm going broke. You want to help me
steal some chickens?

                         CUT TO:
          Fox's study, the next morning. A map of the valley with notes
and arrows written all over it is spread across a desk. The
door is closed with a towel jammed under it. A cricket match
plays loudly on the radio. Fox sits in his armchair. Kylie
sits in a creaky rocking chair.

                         FOX
          I used to do this professionally, and I
was very successful at it. I had to get
out of it for personal reasons, but I've
decided to secretly quit my job slash got
fired to pursue it again. I'm bringing
you in as my secretary and personal
assistant.









          18.

                         KYLIE

          OK!

                         FOX

                         (PRICKLY)
          This is actually kind of a big deal, so
don't just say, "OK!"

                         KYLIE
          OK. Well, thank you.

                         FOX
          (clearing is throat)
I'm going totape this formyrecords,so
don't make a lot of sounds --meaning
stop rocking.

                         KYLIE

                         (DEFENSIVELY)
          Well, maybe we ought to turn off the
radio, then. That's noisier than --

                         FOX
          I don't want people to eavesdrop on us,
Kylie. Let me just tell this.
Kylie stops rocking. Fox presses record on a tape recorder.

                         HE BEGINS:

                         FOX
          Master Plan. Phase one. Side A.

                         CUT TO:
          That night. Fox stands on a rock at the edge of the woods
looking through his binoculars. He lowers them and gives a
hand-signal. Kylie joins him, and they start out along the
moonlit ridge. Fox wears a dark car-coat and a black cap.
Kylie has on a navy ski-hat.

          FOX (V.0.)
          We'll start with Boggis' Chicken House
#1. His only security is a few old
hunting beagles and a low stone wall. Now
a word about beagles: never look a beagle
directly in the eye. And if --

          KYLIE (V.0.)

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          Why not?

                         CUT TO:









          19.
          Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. Kylie

                         SAYS BLITHELY:

                         KYLIE
          Beagles aren't so tough.

                         FOX

                         (ANNOYED)
          Yeah? Well, first of all, one of these
beagles has chronic rabies, which he's on
medication for, and if you get bit by him
you have to get shots in your stomach for
six months. And, second -- listen, I'm
not going to justify this to you. Just
pay attention and stop interrupting me.
I'm taping this.

          EXT. RAVINE. NIGHT

Fox and Kylie shimmy down a steep embankment and cross a
stream.

          FOX (V.0.)
          I picked some blueberries, butterflied
them with a scalpel, and laced each one
with ten milligrams of high-potency
sleeping powder.

                         INSERT:
          Fox's paws meticulously sprinkle a powdered mickey into a
dissected blueberry and stitch it shut with red thread.

           FOX (V.0.)
           Enough to tranquilize a charging gorilla.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now
smoke pipes.

                         KYLIE
          How do we make them eat it?

                         FOX
          (smiling, with utter certainty)
Beagles love blueberries.

          EXT. RIDGE. NIGHT

Fox and Kylie push through a bramble and climb to the top of
an elderberry bush. Fox looks through his binoculars.









          20.

          FOX (V.O.)
          If we approach with the wind in our
faces, we'll smell the chicken livers on
Boggis' breath from at least fifty yards
away.

          EXT. BARNYARD. DAY

Seventy-five chickens stand around quietly but anxiously,
darting wildly nervous looks at one another. They eat bits of
grain off the ground.

          FOX (V.O.)
          Remember: they aren't very smart, but
they're incredibly paranoid -- so always
kill a chicken in one bite.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now
drink whiskey sours. Fox repeats:

                         FOX
          One bite, get it?
Fox waits for Kylie to respond. Kylie does not. Fox frowns.

                         FOX
          Are you listening to me? I look into your
eyes and I can't tell whether you're
getting anything I'm saying.
Kylie stares at Fox vacantly. He shrugs.
(NOTE: an alternate set of eyeballs will be used for any
shots indicating Kylie's vacant look.)

          EXT. MEADOW. NIGHT

Fox and Kylie move swiftly through the tall grass. Fox pauses
to sniff the air. He nods.

                         FOX
          A few beagles, as we discussed, but we're
ready for that.
Fox and Kylie cross a dirt lane and come out of a shallow
ditch. Fox licks the pinky of his paw and holds it up in the
air.

                         FOX
          You feel that? The wind's in our faces.









          21.
          Kylie touches his face with his paw. He nods. Fox and Kylie
run along the edge of the ditch. Kylie says casually:

                         KYLIE
          Yeah, back in the old days, didn't they
used to do a thing where if somebody saw
a wolf, and --

                         FOX

                         (STARTLED)
          What wolf?
Fox stops in his tracks. His eyes dart about. Kylie looks at
him curiously.

                         FOX
          Oh, nothing? Never mind.
Fox and Kylie veer off into shorter grasses. Fox points
ahead, regaining his composure:

                         FOX
          Here comes the low stone wall. Not a
problem.
Fox and Kylie climb over a low stone wall and find themselves
at the base of a chain-link fence eleven feet high.

                         FOX
          This is a chain-link fence, I guess. Did
I not remember this? Maybe it's new.
Let's pause.

                         (SUDDENLY ANGRY)
          What the cuss? Where'd this giant fence
come from? We had a master plan!
Kylie motions to a yellow, plywood lightning bolt posted to
the fence.

                         KYLIE
          What's this lightning bolt stand for?

                         FOX
          Give me a second! I said, "Let's pause"!
Pause. Fox pulls himself together. He turns to look at the
plywood lightning bolt.

                         FOX
          That, I guess, hypothetically, could mean
maybe this fence might be electric.









          22.

                         KYLIE
          Well, I just hope it doesn't mean
thunder. I have a phobia of that.
Fox and Kylie climb a tree and crouch at the end of one of
its branches. Fox produces a zip-loc bag filled with
blueberries with white thread stitched into them.

                         FOX
          Watch this.
Fox puts a blueberry into the end of a straw and shoots it
out into the barnyard.

                         CUT TO:
          The blueberry landing on the ground in front of Chicken House
#1. A beagle approaches it and sniffs at it. He eats it. He
looks very pleased. He falls over, out cold.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox with an ecstatic expression on his face. He rapidly
shoots more and more blueberries across the barnyard. Beagles
eat blueberries and fall over, one after another. Fox and
Kylie drop down into the barnyard and head for Chicken House
#1. Fox whispers excitedly as they run:

                         FOX
          Beagles love blueberries! Didn't I tell
you? The master plan's working again!
Kylie raises his fist enthusiastically and trips over an
unconscious beagle. He picks himself up quickly, and they
weave among the rest of the beagles. They reach the entrance
to the chicken house, open the door, and duck inside.
Pause. There is an eruption of crazed squawking, screaming,
and fighting from inside. The chicken house rumbles. Lights
jolt on across the compound. An alarm goes off. Voices yell.
The chicken house door swings open again, and Fox and Kylie
emerge among a cloud of feathers. Fox carries two dead
chickens, and Kylie has one live one. Fox yells:

                         FOX
          I said one bite, cuss it!

                         KYLIE
          I'm trying! I have a different kind of
teeth from you! I'm an opossum!









          23.
          Kylie tries to bite the chicken on the neck. The chicken is
unharmed. Kylie shrugs. Fox kills the chicken with one quick
flick of the jaws. Kylie looks horrified.

                         KYLIE
          That's so grisly! There's blood and
everything!

                         FOX

                         (DEFENSIVELY)
          We're killing chickens! There's going to
be blood in this story! Follow me!
Fox and Kylie dash to the electric fence. They stop in front
of it. Kylie looks to Fox.

                         KYLIE
          What's the master escape plan?
Fox hesitates, confused. A gunshot fires from among the
chicken houses. Fox shouts to Kylie:

                         FOX
          Follow me again!
Fox and Kylie run back across the barnyard, past the beagles
as they begin to wake up and stagger around. Farmhands
appear, loading shotguns and running into the confusion. Fox
and Kylie race by, unnoticed, among them. They dart into the
house through a flap in the back door. The lights are out in
the kitchen. They take a moment, breathing hard in the
darkness. Kylie shakes his head in disbelief.

                         KYLIE
          Wow. That was amazing. How did we do
that? We ran the other way or something.

                         FOX
          Yeah.

                         KYLIE
          What happens now?

                         FOX
          I have no idea.
Fox opens the door-flap a crack. He looks out and sees Boggis
opening the front gate to let out his beagles and farmhands,
barking and shooting, as they search for the intruders. Fox
shouts to Kylie:









          24.

                         FOX
          Holy cuss! They opened the gate! Follow
me again!
Lightning quick, Fox and Kylie burst out through the door-
flap, race across the barnyard, and dart through the open
gate. Up the road, Boggis screams furiously as he runs with
his pack of beagles and farmhands. Fox and Kylie fly into the
bushes. As they race through the underbrush Fox says

                         BREATHLESSLY:

                         FOX
          Let's hit the five and dime on the way
home! We need to make some fake price
tags and wrap these chickens in wax-paper
so it looks like we got them at the
butcher shop!
Fox and Kylie howl ecstatically.

                         MONTAGE:
          A fox's paw lifts a silver dome off a perfectly roasted
chicken with an apple in its mouth.
Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at a candle-lit table eating chicken and
drinking wine. Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at a
slightly miniature table eating chicken and drinking milk.
Fox laughs hysterically as he tells his wife a story. Wine
comes out of his nose.
Fox and Kylie dash out the door of Boggis' Chicken House #7
carrying three more dead chickens. Lights jolt on. Farmhands
run out firing shotguns. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
cut into the electric fence.
Fox and Kylie dash out the window of Bunce's Poultry Barn C
carrying two dead ducks and a goose. Alarms ring. Farmhands
run out firing pistols. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
knocked into a brick wall.
Fox and Kylie dash out the gates of Bean's Apple Orchard XII
carrying two dead turkeys and a basket of apples. Automatic
doors close. Farmhands run out firing rifles. Fox and Kylie
escape through a hole chopped into a burning barricade.
Fox and Kylie run full-speed through a clover field in the
dark. The camera zooms in slowly on their faces as they ford
a stream, leap a fallen hawthorn, and cross into the willow
glade. They look exhilarated.









          25.

          INT. KITCHEN. EVENING

Mrs. Fox studies a crayon price-tag labelled $4 attached to a
wax-paper-wrapped parcel. She opens the parcel and holds up a
dead chicken by the leg. There is a small metal clip around
its ankle. She examines it. She frowns.
Fox comes in, grabs an apple out of a bowl, and starts back
out of the room.

          MRS. FOX
          Where'd you get this chicken?

                         FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          I picked it up at the Five-and-Dime last
night on my way back from --

          MRS. FOX
          It's got a Boggis Farms tag around its
ankle.

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Huh. Must've escaped from there before I
bought it.

          INT. DINING ROOM. EVENING

Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at the children's table
eating dinner. Next to Ash, there is a small, slightly beaten-
up statue of a fox with his front legs raised in the air
holding a medal above his head. Kylie points at it.

                         KYLIE
          What's that?

                         ASH
          This? Nothing. Just some old trophy I won
for being an athlete.
Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at the adults' table. Fox guzzles down a
last sip of wine and says with his mouth full of food:

                         FOX
          I'm supposed to cover this book party at
some animal's nest in a tobacco field
down the hill, so me and Kylie are going
to hop over there and give it a whirl.
Don't wait up.
Fox pulls his napkin out of his collar, drops it on the
table, and stands up. Mrs. Fox asks cooly:









          26.

          MRS. FOX
          What's the book?

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Some memoir. I'll get him to sign you a
copy.
Fox kisses Mrs. Fox on the cheek. She looks at him
suspiciously.

                         FOX
          Dinner was --
(doing a little gesture)
-- pitch-perfect.

          EXT. WOODS. NIGHT

Fox and Kylie walk among the trees. They are dressed in their
prowling outfits.

                         FOX
          I spotted a couple of broken burglar bars
underneath the back door to Bean's secret
cider cellar.

                         KYLIE
          We're breaking into Bean's house?

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Cellar.

                         KYLIE
          Where he lives?

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Where he keeps the cider.

                         ASH

                         (BRIGHTLY)
          Below where he lives.
Ash, dressed in his own prowling outfit, is walking with Fox
and Kylie. Fox stops short:

                         FOX
          Where'd you come from? Go back to the
tree and do your homework!

                         ASH
          I want to help you steal some cider.









          27.

                         FOX

                         (ANGRILY)
          We're going to a book party! And keep
your mouth shut about any cider, because
no one ever said that! Get out of here!

                         ASH
          But Dad --

                         FOX
          But nothing! You're going to get me in a
lot of trouble!
The three animals stand in silence for a minute. Fox points
to his tree. Ash turns and starts back home. Fox shakes his
head.

                         FOX
          Where the cuss does that kid get off? Can
you believe that? How'd he get tipped
off? You think he's going to tell on us?
Fox turns to Kylie. Kylie looks back at him vacantly.

                         FOX
          Before we go any further, from now on can
you give me some kind of signal once in a
while just so I know any of this is
getting through to you?
Pause. Kylie makes a slight motion with his paw. Fox
hesitates.

                         FOX
          Was that it? OK.

          EXT. BARNYARD. NIGHT

Fox and Kylie dart across the yard and around the back of
Bean's farmhouse. Kylie whispers as they run:

                         KYLIE
          One time this wolf --

                         FOX

                         (IRRITATED)
          What's with all the wolf talk? Can we
give it a rest, for once?
Fox climbs onto a garbage pail and pulls open a window
shutter. He and Kylie shimmy in-between two bent burglar
bars.









          28.

          INT. BEAN'S SECRET CIDER CELLAR. NIGHT

A vast, damp, gloomy cellar with hundreds of glass jars
stacked from floor to ceiling. Each jar is marked Cider. Fox
and Kylie come inside and quietly drop to the brick floor.

                         KYLIE WHISPERS:

                         KYLIE
          Look at all this apple juice.

                         FOX

                         (STERNLY)
          Apple juice? Apple juice? We didn't come
here for apple juice. This is some of the
strongest, finest alcoholic cider money
can buy -- or that can even be stolen. It
burns in your throat, boils in your
stomach, and tastes almost exactly like
pure, melted gold.

                         (SUDDENLY)
          Let's crack open one these 'shine jars
and do a shooter.
A match strikes in the darkness. Fox and Kylie look around
the room frantically. On the highest shelf, peering out from
behind a huge jar, they see an enormous rat in a striped
shirt with a lit match in his claw. He puts the flame in his
mouth to snuff it out and holds the matchstick in his teeth.
He is longer than a fox and wiry, but with a small pot-belly.
He wears a black beret and moves like a beatnik.
He takes a draw from a small rubber tube inserted in the neck
of his cider jar. He says with a slightly sinister New

                         ORLEANS ACCENT:

                         RAT
          Y'all are trespassin', now. Illegally.
'Round these parts, we don't take kindly
to cider poachers.
Fox and Rat stare at each other. Fox says, finally:

                         FOX
          You've aged badly, Rat.

                         RAT
          You're gettin' a little long in the
tooth, yourself, partner.
Rat spins around and hurls himself scuttling over a shelf,
down the wall, and through the air onto the brick floor at
Fox's feet. He flicks open a switchblade and brandishes it.
He hisses.









          29.
          Kylie shrieks and darts into a hole where a brick is missing
in the wall. Fox takes an old-fashioned boxing stance.

                         RAT
          How's your old lady doin'?
Kylie peers out from his hole in the wall nervously. Fox and
Rat circle each other slowly.

                         FOX
          Do you refer to my wife?

                         RAT
          She was the town tart, in her day. Wild
and foot-loose and pretty as a mink
stole. She was a creme brulee -- until
you made an honest woman out of her, Mr.
Fox.
Kylie says, intrigued, from his hole:

                         KYLIE
          Is that true?

                         FOX

                         (ANNOYED)
          Of course, not. I mean, certainly, she
lived. We all did. It was a different
time. Let's not use a double-standard.
She marched against the --

                         KYLIE
          But town tart?

                         FOX
          Shut up.
Rat lunges at Fox with his switchblade. Fox dodges nimbly. He
cocks an eyebrow and smiles:

                         FOX
          That was close, Rat. Be careful.

                         RAT
          Oh, I'm as careful as a --
A door at the top of the stairs opens suddenly with a loud
creak. Rat and Fox look terrified. They both dart away and
hide behind cider jars.
A heavy-set, middle-aged housekeeper carrying a rolling pin
comes down the stairs and walks straight over to the shelf
where Fox is hiding.









          30.

                         HOUSEKEEPER
          How many jars should I bring up, ma'am?
A strong, almost masculine woman's voice answers from

                         UPSTAIRS:

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          I don't know. Two, I guess.
The housekeeper grabs the two jars directly next to the one
Fox is hiding behind and tucks them under her arm. Fox tenses
his body. He shivers slightly. A graze of the red fur of his
arm sticks out barely from behind his jar. The housekeeper
hesitates.

                         HOUSEKEEPER
          He drank three yesterday, ma'am.

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          All right, take three.
The housekeeper grabs Fox's jar. Fox closes his eyes.

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          No, don't.
The housekeeper stops with her hand on the neck of Fox's jar.

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          Three's too many. It's unhealthy. He's
anorexic. Bring two.
The housekeeper lets go of Fox's jar. Fox relaxes slightly.
The housekeeper grabs Fox's jar again. Fox tenses up.

                         HOUSEKEEPER
          But maybe, just in case --

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          Two's plenty.
The housekeeper lets go of Fox's jar and walks away. She goes
back up the stairs and closes the door. Kylie says in the

                         DARKNESS:

                         KYLIE
          Oh, my cuss. That was like a scene out of

                         A --
          The door opens again. An exceptionally tall, powerfully built
woman in a black dress and Wellingtons, with grey hair pulled-
back in a bun, bright green eyes, and a meat cleaver tucked
under her apron strings comes swiftly down the stairs. She









          31.
          eyeballs the corners of the room. She is Mrs. Bean. She says
thickly (in her masculine voice):

          MRS. BEAN
          To whom it may concern: if I catch a rat
in a black beret drinking Mr. Bean's
secret cider without his express
permission, I intend to chop said rat's
head off, brine it, pickle it, and bake
it in a vermin casserole. I hope this
clarifies my position on the matter.
Sincerely, Evelyn Bean.
Mrs. Bean turns and goes back up the stairs. She closes the
door. Pause. Rat's voice says from the shadows:

                         RAT
          Dear Mrs. Bean, your language, while
somewhat purple, is nevertheless
impossible to misinterpret. However --
comma -- given the proximity of said rat
at the moment of your --
The door at the top the stairs opens again. Silence.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Kylie running away from Bean's farmhouse with two
jars of cider. They both look badly shaken. A gunshot rings
out taking us to:

          EXT. BEAN FARMS. NIGHT

Bean is standing darkly in his front doorway. Smoke drifts
from the end of his Luger, pointed at the ceiling. A broken
light bulb hangs from a wire above his head. Boggis and Bunce
sit together on the porch in rocking chairs, startled,
staring at Bean.

                         BEAN
          I'm going to give a speech, and at the
end of it -- I'm going to throw a twist
into this plot.
Bean lights a cigarette and begins to walk slowly around the
porch.

                         BEAN
          First truth: this is the most ambitious
fox we've ever encountered, bar none.
Bean spins around and shoots out a second light bulb. Boggis
and Bunce look uneasy. Bean continues:









          32.

                         BEAN
          Second truth: the meaning of ambition is
defined in the dictionary.
Bean jumps and rolls and shoots out a third light bulb.

                         BEAN
          Third truth: the weakness of the
ambitious man is his Achilles heel --
Bean quickly shoots out three more light bulbs behind his
back, over his shoulder, and between his legs. The porch goes
dark. He flicks on a flashlight and points it in his two
colleague's faces. They look scared. Bean says urgently:

                         BEAN
          -- but I've already figured out where
this fox lives, and tomorrow night we're
going to camp in the bushes, wait for him
to come out of the hole in his tree, and
shoot the cuss to smithereens. How's that
grab you, fellas?
Boggis and Bunce hesitate. They nod and murmur their
approval.

          INT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT

Fox and Kylie come quietly into the half-lit kitchen dressed
in their prowling outfits. They walk to the door.

          MRS. FOX
          Another book party?
Fox and Kylie turn around, startled. Mrs. Fox sits on a stool
in the darkened pantry.

                         FOX
          Woah! I didn't see you. Sitting in the
dark over there. Yeah, no. Actually,
there's a fire. I just got the call. They
said maybe it's arson? I got to interview
the marshall and see what's --

          MRS. FOX
          Kylie, is he telling the truth?

                         KYLIE

                         (FREAKING OUT)
          I don't want to be put in the middle of
this.









          33.

                         FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          Thanks, Kylie.

          MRS. FOX
          If what I think is happening is

                         HAPPENING --

                         (OMINOUSLY)
          -- it better not be.

                         CUT TO:
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting crouched in the bushes. Bean
licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction of the
wind. He nods, points to his nose, and gives a thumbs-up to
Boggis and Bunce.

          EXT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT

Fox pokes his head up out of his hole. He sniffs once. He
moves an inch forward and stops. He sniffs again. He waits a
moment and listens. He steps out of the hole and says

                         STONILY:

                         FOX
          Nice job covering for me. Next time

                         TRY --
          A twig snaps. Fox freezes.

                         CUT TO:
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean frozen in the bushes.

                         CUT TO:
          The branches of the trees as the wind suddenly changes its
direction.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox on high alert. He rapidly sniffs the air three times in a
row. He turns to a confused Kylie and says, panicking:

                         FOX
          All three!
Fox and Kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as
Boggis, Bunce, and Bean open fire wildly from the bushes. A
barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark.
Silence.









          34.
          Smoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air.
Boggis, Bunce, and Bean approach the tree. Bean shines his
flashlight on Fox's hole.
In the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered, blood-
stained remains of Fox's tail. Bean picks it up and holds it
in the air in front of Boggis and Bunce.

                         BEAN
          We got the tail, but we missed the fox.
Pause. Bean takes out his walkie-talkie.

                         BEAN
          Petey? You and the boys sober up and get
out here on the A.S.A.P. Bring eleven
shovels, three pick-axes, 500 rounds of
ammunition, and a bottle of apple cider.

          INT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT

Mrs. Fox licks the stump of Fox's tail and mends it with
gauze and medical tape. She looks furious. Kylie and the Fox
cubs watch, concerned. Ash says uncertainly:

                         ASH
          It'll grow back, won't it?

                         KYLIE
          (shaking his head)
Tails don't grow back, except for
lizards.

                         FOX

                         (MISERABLY)
          Tails don't grow back. I'm going to be
tail-less for the rest of my life.

                         ASH

                         (NERVOUSLY)
          Well, anyway, it's not half as bad as
double-pneumonia, right?
(pointing to Kristofferson)
His dad's got one foot in the grave and
one foot on a banana peel. That's a lot
worse than --
Kristofferson hurls an acorn violently onto the floor. It
ricochets off a wall and into a teacup. Everyone falls
silent. Kristofferson turns away.









          35.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Excuse me, everyone. I'm going to go
meditate for half an hour.
Kristofferson walks out of the room. Mrs. Fox looks at Ash
and says angrily:

          MRS. FOX
          You've got twenty-nine minutes to come up
with a proper apology.
Ash crosses his arms in front of his chest and stares
straight ahead into space grimly. Fox says suddenly:

                         FOX
          What's with the crazy outfit? Why a cape
and the pants tucked into your socks?
Ash does not respond. Fox sighs. Mrs. Fox finishes bandaging
his tail. Fox goes over to the wall and stands with his back
to the room.

                         FOX
          I got fired slash quit the Gazette and
started stealing chickens on the sly.

          MRS. FOX

                         (ICILY)
          That tail was the first thing I ever
noticed about you. It was easily the most
attractive tail for at least 50 miles in
every direction. It was probably your
single best quality -- and now it's gone
forever.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox lying in bed staring at the ceiling in the dark next to
Mrs. Fox.

                         FOX
          Why the cuss didn't I listen my lawyer?
At this point we'll be lucky if we can
flip this tree for half of what we've
already sunk into it.
Fox flips over onto his stomach.

                         FOX
          I won't be able to sleep on my back for
six weeks -- and on my stomach I feel
congested. Why the cuss didn't I listen
to my lawyer?









          36.

          MRS. FOX

                         (BITTERLY)
          Because you don't listen to anybody.

                         FOX
          (sitting up suddenly)
What was that?

          MRS. FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          What? I said --
There is a quiet scraping sound from above. Fox jumps out of
bed. He hollers:

                          FOX
           Wake up! Everybody! They're digging us
out!
There is a scrunch and then a loud thump from above. Mrs. Fox
looks at Fox intensely:

          MRS. FOX
          They'll kill the children!

                         FOX

                         (STEELY)
          Over my dead body, they will.

          MRS. FOX

                         (ANGRILY)
          That's what I'm saying! You'd be dead,
too, in that scenario!

                         FOX

                         (ANGRILY)
          Well, I'm arguing against that!

          MRS. FOX

                         (SCREAMING)
          What are you talking about?

                         FOX

                         (SCREAMING)
          Why are you yelling at me?

                         KYLIE

                         (AGONIZED)
          Stop! Stop! Stop!
Fox and Mrs. Fox turn quickly to Kylie standing in the
doorway with a red blanket wrapped around his shoulders. Ash









          37.
          and Kristofferson stand behind him. They look terrified.
Kylie shouts in a pained voice:

                         KYLIE
          You say one thing, she says another, and
it all changes back again!
The point of a shovel pierces the ceiling. Everyone looks up
and stares in shock. Fox suddenly leaps across the room with
a wild energy, scrambles halfway up a wall, and throws over
two chairs.

                         FOX
          I've got it! There's not a moment to
lose! Why didn't I think of this before?

          MRS. FOX
          Think of what?

                         FOX
          Think of the one thing a fox does quicker
than a man, quicker than any other animal
in the world!
(at the top of his lungs)

          DIG!!!

                         CUT TO:
          Everyone digging furiously. Dirt flies everywhere. The shot
booms down into the ground, among the roots of the tree,
through buried pebbles, layers of soil, and subterranean
mineral deposits.

                         TITLE:

                         1 HOUR LATER
          The shot stops at the bottom of a dark hole deep, deep
underground. Mrs. Fox lies on the floor, breathing heavily,
with a lit lantern at her side. The cubs are sprawled out
around her. Kylie leans in the corner with his shirt off tied
around his waist. Fox stands up and clears his throat.
Everyone looks at him.

                         FOX
          I think it's time for me to give us a pep
talk and explain some things.
(commencing a speech)
A very long time ago --

          MRS. FOX
          May I have a word with you privately?









          38.

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Well, we're in a hole. Where --

          MRS. FOX
          Just on the other side of this mineral
deposit. Follow me.
Fox reluctantly follows Mrs. Fox through a crack in the
bedrock and into a small air-pocket with glittering quartz
walls. She wheels on Fox:

          MRS. FOX
          I'm going to lose my temper now.

                         FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          When?

          MRS. FOX
          Right now.

                         FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          Well, when --
Mrs. Fox scratches Fox across the face, slicing a quick
sliver into his fur. Fox cringes away with his paws up
protectively. He lowers his paws. His eyes fill with tears.
(NOTE: the scar in Fox's fur never grows back.)
Mrs. Fox takes a deep breath. She says:

          MRS. FOX
          Twelve fox-years ago, you made a promise
to me while we were caged inside that fox-
trap that, if we survived, you would
never steal another chicken, goose,
turkey, duck, or squab, whatever they
are. I believed you. Why did you lie to
me?

                         FOX

                         (SIMPLY)
          Because I'm a wild animal.

          MRS. FOX
          You're also a husband and a father.









          39.

                         FOX

                         (PAINED)
          I'm trying to tell you the truth about
myself.

          MRS. FOX
          I don't care about the truth about
yourself.
Fox looks down at the ground. He nods and tries to contain
his emotions. Mrs. Fox watches him coldly.

          MRS. FOX
          This story is too predictable.

                         FOX

                         (SURPRISED)
          Predictable? Really? What happens in the
end?

          MRS. FOX

                         (QUIETLY)
          In the end, we all die -- unless you
change.
Mrs. Fox walks out of the air-pocket. Fox stands alone in
silence.

          EXT. FOX'S TREE. DAY

The next morning. There is a large hole in the side of the
hill, under Fox's tree. The ceiling to the living room has
been completely removed. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand half-
underground with their heads sticking out of the hole,
breathing hard, with dirty shovels over their shoulders.
Bunce stands on Fox's tiny club chair.

                         BUNCE
          These foxes dig like a bunch of
hyperactive gophers.

                         BOGGIS
          Franklin? You got another twist for this
plot?

                         BEAN
          Say that again?

                         BOGGIS
          I say you got another --
Bean whips out his walkie-talkie and twirls it like a six-
shooter. He presses a button on it and says:









          40.

                         BEAN
          Petey? Get me the current contact info
for Earl Malloy on the A.S.A.P.

                         BUNCE

                         (INTRIGUED)
          Who's Earl Malloy?

                         BEAN

                         (INNOCENTLY)
          What? You mean over at Malloy
Consolidated? Oh, he does rentals.

                         BOGGIS

                         (PAUSE)
          What does he rent?

                         CUT TO:
          Three yellow and black, murderous, brutal bulldozer digging-
tractors with Malloy Consolidated painted on the sides of
them. They make a terrible, high-pitched growling noise and
spit black grease and smoke.
Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand among the tractors nodding
giddily to each other. They scramble into the drivers' seats
and begin ripping into the hillside. Bunce sits on a
dictionary to see over the dashboard.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox, Mrs. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson digging
frantically.

                         CUT TO:
          The tractors grabbing huge chunks of earth and tossing them
into the meadow. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, drunk with digging,
laugh manically as the controls of their tractors.

                         BEAN
          Let's kick some fox cuss!

                         BUNCE
          I'm cussing loving this!

                         BOGGIS
          Who's hyper-cussing-active now?
Bean throws his tractor into top gear. The teeth of the giant
shovels clank against each other, ripping through the tree's
roots.

          A temperature gauge with its needle pushing the limits of the
red.

                         CUT TO:
          A grizzled, white-haired man in a greasy yellow and black
jumpsuit and coke-bottle protective eyeglasses. A patch on
his pocket says E. Malloy. He watches the farmers digging
crazily with the tractors. Sparks from the mayhem reflect
dancing on his lenses.

                         EARL MALLOY
          These machines weren't made to be handled
like this.

                         DISSOLVE TO:
          The hill with half its earth dug out from under the tree. The
tree still stands precariously above the wild tractors.

                         DISSOLVE TO:
          The hill now razed with the fallen, old beech tree laying on
its side as the tractors dig deeper.

                         DISSOLVE TO:
          The tractors almost completely below ground in a deep crater.
A crowd of neighbors and local press from the town has
gathered and watches as the tractors stop digging and rumble
up out of the crater. The motors go quiet. Boggis, Bunce, and
Bean climb down from their tractors. They look angry and
tired. They stand among the workers and onlookers.
A television reporter with an Action 13 camera crew confronts

                         BEAN:
