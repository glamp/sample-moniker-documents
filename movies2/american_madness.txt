                         Of a large, impressive-looking building 
on the corner of a busy, New York business 
street.






                         A dignified brass plate sign on the 
side of the building, reading: UNION 
                         NATIONAL BANK.

one side of which is partly opened. 
Sitting in front of the closed side 
is a uniformed officer, greeting, ad 
lib, the various employees as they enter.

in wires.



                         (mechanically sweet voice)

                         Good morning . . . Union National Bank 
. . . Just a minute






                         Of the inside of a massive vault door, 
made impressive by the shining, finely 
cut steel bolts and the many other intricate-looking 
instruments which adorn it.

                         CAMERA PANS UP to a clock overhead which 
registers 9:03.

                         A group of young men, paying tellers, 
are impatiently watching a teller struggle 
with the lock that will admit them to 
the vault.



                         Come on, come on, Oscar, what are we 
waiting for?



                         What's the matter? Can't you find it?




                         Sneak up on it, boy!



                         Oscar, come on!



                         Say, if it had lipstick on it, he'd 
find it!

                         They all laugh, as Oscar finds the combination.






                         Almonds to you![1] Almonds!



                         Now, now, Oscar - not almonds!

                         The CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they pass 
through the first portal.



                         Nine o'clock and all is lousy!



                         Yes, I spend half of my life waiting 
for these time clocks to open. Say, 
where's Matt?



                         Probably upstairs thinking up that daily 
joke.



                         That guy kills me with his wisecracks.




                         Say, when he comes in, let's put on 
a frozen face. Let's not smile.

                         They ad-lib agreement.



                         Shhh! Nix! Here he comes



                         CAMERA PICKS UP Matt Brown, the chief 
teller, as he strides briskly in and 
begins turning the combination dial 
to the main vault. He is about twenty-six, 
a clean-looking, personable youngster. 
Several of the tellers are standing 
close to him, looking on.



                         How are you doing slaves?



                         Hello, Matt. How're you Matt?

                         Matt begins to work the combination 
of the main lock.



                         (with his back to them)

                         Say, did you boys ever hear the story 
of the pawnbroker with the glass eye?




                         No Matt, what is the story about the 
pawnbroker with the glass eye?



                         (as he continues to fiddle with the 
lock)

                         Well, I'll tell you. A fellow went into 
this shop to pawn his watch. The pawnbroker 
said, "I'll give you $50 for it, if 
you can tell me which is my glass eye." 
The fellow said, "All right, I'll do 
that. It's the right one." The pawnbroker 
said, "That's correct. But how did you 
know it was the right one?" The fellow




                         said, "well, it's got more sympathy 
than the other one."

                         He turns, expecting their laugh, but 
is confronted by stone faces.



                         Sympathy! You know, the right one had 
more sympathy than the other one!




                         What's the matter? Can't you get this 
thing open?

                         Matt stares in disbelief, then gets 
the joke.



                         (contemptuously)

                         Six reasons why banks fail!

                         This cracks them all up, as a uniformed 
officer, who has been standing by, works 
a lever attached to the floor, which 
lowers a section of the floor, directly 
in front of the vault. This permits 
the vault door, which is sunk below 
the floor level, to swing open.



                         (ad-libbing)

                         I love your jokes, Matt! They're so 
entertaining! A very funny man!



                         Matt opens the inside door, made up 
of perpendicular steel bars. The tellers 
scurry into the cavernous-looking interior. 
Someone snaps on a light. CAMERA TRUCKS 
                         UP TO VAULT.

                         The back walls of the vault are lined 
with steel cabinets divided into many 
small compartments. On one side is a 
wall safe which is also opened by a 
combination and which contains the surplus 
cash carried by the bank. Matt is in 
charge of this. All around the room 
are numerous hand trucks - one for every 
teller. These trucks contain the cash 
in the charge of the individual tellers. 
While the tellers in the b.g. obtain 
their keys and open the drawers of their 
trucks, Matt examines the time clock 
which is attached to the inside of the 
vault door.



                         At the door, as Matt enters and goes 
directly to the burglar alarm box to 
the left of the doorway. He leans over 
to throw off the burglar alarm switch.







                         The handle of the switch points in the 
direction of a sign reading ON. Matt's 
hand comes into the scene and throws 
the switch up toward a sign reading 
OFF. This is done with no comment, it 
being a routine matter with Matt.




                         Come on, white collars. The day's started!




                         As the tellers file out with their trucks. 
Before they do, however, each one signs 
the cashbook. One or two exit silently.






                         As one of the tellers comes into scene. 
Matt examines the cashbook.



                         You're carrying too much money on you, 
Hank. You better turn some in tonight.




                         (as he goes)

                         Okay, Matt.

                         He exits out of scene.



                         How are you fixed?



                         I'm okay, Matt.



                         (to another teller)

                         You've got enough?



                         I'll be all right.

                         Charlie, the last man, comes up.



                         Say Matt, I'll have to have some money 
for those Manville payrolls.



                         How much?



                         About twenty-four thousand.



                         (counting out money)

                         It was more than that last week.



                         Yeah.



                         Here's twenty-five thousand.

                         He hands Charlie four stacks of bills. 
As Charlie is signing the cash book, 
Matt speaks:



                         Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?




                         Yeah.



                         Let me have ten bucks?



                         (aghast)

                         Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, 
I'd quit.



                         Charlie!





                         Yeah?

                         Charlie starts out. Matt follows him.





                         As Charlie comes out, followed by Matt. 
CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG WITH THEM as they 
walk.



                         (as they walk)

                         I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on 
the level I will. Give a guy a break, 
will you? I've got to get it back in 
my account. If Helen ever finds out 
that I



                         (unsympathetically)

                         Baby, I can't give you anything but 
love . . .[2]






                         CAMERA TRUCKS with them as Charlie pushes 
his truck forward and Matt walks alongside 
of him. En route, CAMERA TAKES IN ATMOSPHERIC 
SHOTS of the general activity backstage 
of the bank.

                         Male and female clerks stand around 
at various angles, checking away at 
adding machines. Several are assisted 
by someone who calls off figures to 
them as they record it on machines. 
We hear these figures read in a monotone 
as we pass them.

                         Matt is still trying to pry the ten 
dollars loose from Charlie.



                         Now listen Charlie. I'll give you an 
I.O.U. I'll give you a note, I'll pay 
your mortgage, it's a matter of life 
and death

                         Ad-lib conversations from the other 
clerks distract his attention.



                         Whose death?



                         It'll be yours if you don't kick in 
with that ten bucks.



                         Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?




                         Aw, nerts!

                         Charlie arrives at his cage. CAMERA 
STOPS with them.



                         Come over and see us sometime.

                         CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW Matt as he 
continues on to his cage, muttering 
half to himself.



                         I'm not asking you to pay off the Depression. 
I'm only asking you for ten bucks!




                         Another teller is busy in the cage next 
to him. Matt addresses him, referring 
to Charlie.



                         That mug reminds me of a guy with his 
second dollar.



                         Yeah, what did he do with his first 
one?



                         Bought himself a pocketbook!

                         The teller laughs heartily.



                         THE CAMERA PICKS UP Helen as she crosses 
the main floor of the bank, reaches 
Matt's teller window and pushes it open.




                         Hello, Helen!



                         (conspiratorially)

                         Matt, come here!



                         Why?



                         Come here, honey!

                         He leans over, and she gives him a quick 
kiss.



                         Hey, look out, somebody's likely to 
see us!



                         (already walking away)

                         Oh, is that so?

                         She quickly kisses him again, crosses 
back, and takes the grand stairs up 
to the outer office of the bank president 
as Matt watches with a grin.




                         Just then, a group of five or six important-looking 
men enter scene on the way to the conference 
room. One of the men looks towards Helen's 
desk.



                         On Helen and a secretary standing next 
to her.



                         (to Helen)

                         Oh, oh. Look who's here.



                         The other clerks and tellers, noticing 
the newcomers as they file past.



                         Hey, psst!





                         Oh, oh. Five ill winds.



                         (standing next to Oscar)

                         And blowing no good for the old man, 
either.



                         Shooting toward Helen.



                         (acidly)

                         The four-and-a-half horsemen.[3]



                         What are they doing here? There's no 
board meeting today.



                         Search me.

                         By this time, the important group of 
men have reached Helen, and are passing 
her by, with perfunctory nods.



                         (the most important of the important-looking 
men; to Helen)

                         Mr. Dickson in yet?



                         Not yet, Mr. Clark.



                         When he comes in, tell him we're waiting 
for him in the board room.



                         Yes, sir.



                         And tell him not to delay.



                         Yes, sir.

                         The group of men file through the board 
room door, and out of sight.



                         (to Helen)

                         Looks like trouble for your boss.



                         Takes more than two tons of directors 
to make trouble for my boss.



                         (as she turns to go)

                         Sez you!




                         Taking in all of room. The directors 
are all here, and some sit around a 
long, narrow mahogany table. Clark, 
the sour-faced old



                         bird we saw previously talking to Helen, 
paces back and forth agitatedly.



                         I've sent for the cashier, gentlemen. 
He has a list of the loans that Dickson 
made last month.



                         As he stops in his pacing a moment and 
addresses the directors further:



                         And as I told you at breakfast, it is 
time we did something about it.



                         In thorough accord with Clark's violent 
attitude is Schultz, a German, whose 
instinctive conservatism rebels against 
Dickson's liberal banking methods.




                         Mr. Clark's right. Dickson will ruin 
this bank if we don't stop him.



                         (another conservative stalwart)

                         Looks to me as if we're in hot water 
already.

                         A very dignified but meek little old 
man, Jonathan Ives, tries horning in:




                         (feeble-voiced)

                         Gentlemen, I was just wondering



                         As another of the directors, O'Brien, 
a large, bull-faced, thunderous-voiced 
contractor, rises to Dickson's defense. 
(O'Brien is always filing his nails, 
even while he talks.)



                         Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken 
about nothing. Dickson's all right.




                         (interrupting)

                         Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper 
than any other institution in the city. 
We're fools to tolerate it.



                         That's what I say. And the only way 
to end it is to get Dickson out.



                         He looks toward Schultz.



                         Don't make me laugh, Schultz!





                         Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must 
agree to this merger with New York Trust






                         What good will that do?



                         What good will that do? Why, it will 
take control away from him. We'll put 
somebody else in charge, call in all 
doubtful loans, and be on safe ground 
again. That's what good it will do!




                         Including Ives in scene with Clark and 
O'Brien. Ives is seated, O'Brien and 
Clark standing by table. Ives tries 
to speak again.



                         It has just occurred to me



                         (interrupting)

                         You're wasting your time, I tell you. 
Dickson won't stand for it.



                         He'll stand for it, if I have anything 
to say about it.

                         Just then they hear door open, and they 
all look towards door leading thru to 
main floor.



                         As he shuts the door behind him. He 
is immaculately groomed, obviously cuts 
quite a dash with the women. He looks 
off toward the men as Clark's voice 
comes in:



                         Ah - come in, Cluett.

                         CAMERA PANS WITH CLUETT as he comes 
forward and puts a paper on the table 
before Clark.



                         Here's the list.



                         Yes, thank you.



                         Anything else?



                         No. Nothing.

                         Cluett exits toward door again. Clark 
picks up the list and looks at it. Then 
he addresses the other men:



                         Look at this. Just look at this. It's 
outrageous. Henry Moore - thirty-six 
thousand. Manny Goldberg - eighty-five 
hundred. Tony Consero - fifty-six thousand 
dollars. Joseph McDonald - eighteen 
thousand. Alvin Jones - sixty-six thousand 
dollars to a hotel that's on its last 
legs. I tell you, people get loans in 
this bank that couldn't borrow five 
cents anywhere else.





                         As the other men group around the loan 
list, which Clark has put back down 
on the table. They all scrutinize it 
carefully.



                         (to the men at large)

                         And on what? "Hunches," he calls it.




                         Some day he'll get a "hunch" about a 
man and give the bank away.



                         He's almost done that already. Our chief 
teller, Matt Brown, is an example of 
that. He breaks into Dickson's house, 
holds him up, and the next day gets 
a job in the bank.



                         Well, as far as I'm concerned



                         A boy who should be in jail, handling 
a bank's cash!






                         Shooting toward Matt, inside the teller's 
cage, busily counting the money he is 
getting ready for Charlie.

                         Helen is outside the cage.



                         Shooting toward Helen.



                         (skeptically)

                         What did you do with it?



                         With what?



                         The ten dollars.



                         (quickly)

                         Oh, ten dollars



                         Yes.



                         (catches himself in time)

                         A friend of mine - yeah, really - his 
mother was terribly sick and she was 
dying, would you believe it?



                         Shooting toward Matt.

                         As she interrupts him:





                         No.



                         Oh, you think I'm lying?



                         Yes.



                         All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you 
called me a liar.



                         Oh, Matt.

                         He reaches forward and takes her hands.




                         Oh honey, why don't we get married? 
Then you can handle it all.

                         Just then Oscar enters the scene, en 
route somewhere. He stops beside Matt, 
notices he and Helen are holding hands.




                         As Helen and Matt separate guiltily.




                         Say, Matt! Matt! Did you hear the news?




                         No, what?



                         Pardon me. All the big shots are in 
a huddle, and it looks like Dickson's 
out on his ear.

                         Helen and Matt react to this piece of 
news. They look at one another. Apparently, 
it will have a definite effect on their 
lives.



                         (to Oscar)

                         Oh, you're kidding me, aren't you?




                         No, I'm not kidding. Everybody's talking 
about it. Ask her.



                         I haven't heard about it.



                         Sure, everybody's talking about it.




                         As he speaks sadly.



                         If that's on the level, there goes my 
assistant cashier's job.



                         Taking the three in.





                         Well, I just thought I'd drop by and 
cheer you up a bit.

                         As he turns to go out of scene, he looks 
at Matt.



                         I'll be seeing you, Matt - in the breadline.







                         The men are all gathered around the 
table now. Apparently, they have been 
discussing ways and means of ousting 
Dickson.

                         As we cut to this scene, Ives is pouring 
himself a glass of water.



                         That ham I had this morning was very 
salty





                         Gentlemen, let's get organized before 
Dickson gets here. Schultz, can I count 
on you?



                         On Schultz, who is seated next to Clark.




                         Absolutely.



                         What about you, Ames?



                         On Ames, who is seated next to Schultz.




                         That's the way I feel about it.



                         Ives, how about you?





                         Well, the way I look at it, it seems 
that



                         (interrupting)

                         All right. O'Brien?



                         At other end of table, where O'Brien 
is.



                         Well, you've got an awful fight on your 
hands. That's all I've got to say.




                         On Clark, determined.





                         Gentlemen, I think it's time that we 
do fight.






                         The outer offices of the bank are in 
this shot. A spacious stretch of desks 
occupied by clerks and junior officers, 
all busily at work.

                         A wizened old doorman is greeting clerks 
as they arrive.



                         (passing by)

                         Hello, Gardiner.



                         Good morning. You're on time this morning. 
It's about time.

                         We see Dickson, looming in the doorway, 
for the first time.



                         As Dickson stops to speak to the doorman. 
Dickson is a man of about fifty, whose 
looks belie his years. There is a robustness 
and virility about him that is compelling. 
His very walk radiates power.

                         He now puts his hand on the old man's 
shoulder.



                         Good morning, Mr. Dickson.



                         John, how's your wife this morning?




                         (looking up, worship in his eyes)

                         Much better this morning, thank you.




                         Got a handkerchief?

                         Gardiner hurriedly produces a handkerchief, 
and starts to blow his nose.



                         Excuse me



                         Wait a minute.

                         (he takes the handkerchief, and polishes 
the brass on Gardiner's uniform)

                         How do you feel this morning?



                         I'm feeling fine this morning.



                         That makes it unanimous. I feel all 
right too.



                         Thank you!

                         As Dickson exits from scene:







                         The smile on his face disappears as 
he sees something which annoys him.




                         (sternly)

                         Oh, Carter!

                         A young man looks up quickly. He is 
smoking a cigarette.



                         Yes sir?



                         You know the rules about smoking . . 
                         .

                         Carter quickly crushes out the cigarette. 
Even as he does so, Dickson reaches 
into his pocket and flips Carter a fresh 
one, which Carter pockets for later.




                         Thank you, sir.

                         Now Dickson passes Matt's cage.



                         (catching Matt's attention)

                         Oh, Matt!

                         Matt looks up. Dickson tosses him a 
wink, and Matt winks back.

                         Dickson walks on towards his office. 
CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF HIM. On the way 
he is greeted by his employees.



                         Good morning, Mr. Dickson. Etc., etc.




                         (pleasantly)

                         Morning. Good morning

                         He is joined by Bill Saunders, a friend 
of his. Bill walks along with Dickson.




                         Hello, Tom.



                         (firmly, but pleasantly)

                         You here again? What do you want?

                         He does not stop. Continues his walk 
toward his office. Bill along-side of 
him.



                         (smiling)

                         What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, 
money, money!



                         Listen, I told you I wasn't interested 
in that deal, didn't I?





                         I want to know why .

                         Dickson notices a man, a janitor without 
a uniform, passing by.



                         (to the man)

                         Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?




                         I haven't any.



                         You haven't got a uniform?



                         No, sir.



                         My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. 
How much does one cost?



                         Why, I don't know.



                         You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. 
You've got to have a uniform.

                         The man exits scene. Bill picks up the 
conversation where he left off.



                         Tom, I never had trouble getting credit 
from you before. When I was flat broke 
you gave me all the money I wanted. 
Now I come to you with a swell deal, 
and the greatest



                         (interrupting)

                         I'll tell you why. I don't like the 
crowd you're mixed up with.

                         (softening)

                         Personally, you can have all the credit 
you want. But for that deal - not a 
cent.



                         But listen, Tom, I

                         They have now reached the anteroom of 
Dickson's private chamber, where Helen 
sits at her desk.




                         As Dickson comes up to Helen at her 
desk. A lady sits nearby. Dickson notices 
her.



                         Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.



                         Good morning, Mr. Dickson.



                         Got my letter?





                         Yes, thank you.



                         Hello, Helen.



                         Good morning.



                         Helen, you're becoming more beautiful 
every day. What are we going to do about 
it?



                         I don't know.



                         Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the 
bank. When are you and Matt going to 
get married?



                         (awkwardly)

                         Why - well, I



                         Ummm. Stalling, eh?

                         (changing tone, professionally)

                         Anything new?



                         Why, the directors are waiting for you 
in the board room.



                         Directors, eh? Long faces?

                         He gestures accordingly.



                         (she trumps his gesture)

                         Longer.



                         (half-under his breath)

                         I haven't got any new stories for them 
this morning, either.

                         Mrs. Pembroke has been standing by, 
waiting to get a word in edgewise. CAMERA 
PANS SLIGHTLY with him to take in the 
lady:



                         Mr. Dickson?



                         Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer 
at the Guaranty. He's going to take 
care of that mortgage for you . . .


                         During this speech the phone bell rings.




                         As Helen picks up the phone and quietly 
answers it. Bill Saunders is standing 
nearby, still waiting to talk to Dickson 
again.





                         (into phone)

                         Hello . . .

                         (she turns to Dickson)

                         Mrs. Dickson on the phone.

                         Dickson comes over to the desk and as 
he picks up the receiver, he looks toward 
Mrs. Pembroke.



                         (to Mrs. Pembroke)

                         You'd better hurry over there. He's 
waiting for you.

                         (then into phone)

                         Hello, dear . . .



                         As he continues, into phone:



                         Where are you? . . . Sure, well, come 
on down right away. Huh? . . . Yes, 
of course I remember. It's tonight.


                         (smiles)

                         See what a social hound I'm becoming! 
. . . All right, goodbye, dear.

                         He hangs up. Mrs. Pembroke is waiting 
for him to finish. She has apparently 
been disappointed in the news he has 
for her.



                         But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were 
going to take care of the mortgage. 
I only want ten thousand. The property 
is worth sixty.



                         (ill-at-ease)

                         Mr. Schaffer will take good care of 
you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe 
twenty . . .



                         He continues talking to the lady, trying 
to get rid of her.



                         Better hurry now. Goodbye. Good luck 
to you!

                         Mrs. Pembroke, bewildered, starts to 
leave.



                         (muttering)

                         Thank you.

                         CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as Mrs. Pembroke 
leaves.



                         (to Helen)

                         Oh, if Mrs. Dickson comes in, will you 
tell her to see Cluett if she needs 
any money?

                         Bill Saunders is still waiting. He corners 
Dickson.



                         What's the idea of turning her down? 
It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.






                         She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages 
from widows.



                         (puzzled)

                         Why not?



                         Shooting toward Dickson.



                         If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, 
won't I?



                         (dumbly)

                         Yes - sure



                         (mimicking him)

                         Yeah - sure!

                         He turns to address a man below - the 
janitor without a uniform.



                         Oh, make that uniform blue.



                         Yes, sir.

                         Abruptly, he heads for the board room. 
Bill is still baffled by Dickson's queer 
reasoning. Suddenly, it dawns on him. 
He shakes his head admiringly.






                         Dickson enters.



                         (blithely; as he counts the board members 
present)

                         One - two - three - four - five. Seven 
more and you'd have a jury!

                         He grabs a walking cane and wields it 
like a golf putter.



                         Well, it's a nice morning, gentlemen. 
How about two foursomes of golf?



                         (eagerly)

                         Oh, I say, that would be . . .

                         Ives's voice trails off as he realizes 
Clark is scowling at him.



                         (undeterred; still practicing his golf 
swing)

                         Say, you know, I found out something 
yesterday about hitting a golf ball. 
You've got to hit with the left hand, 
and from the inside out, it's the only 
way you can hit anything





                         (huffy)

                         I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like 
to have a little of your very valuable 
time here at the bank this morning, 
if you don't mind.



                         Oh, you would, eh? All right. If it's 
more important than golf, go ahead. 
What's on your mind?






                         Shooting from one end of the lobby toward 
the front door. Depositors are scattered 
all over the place. Some at the windows. 
Some at the writing tables. Others sitting 
inside the railing, talking to junior 
executives. The scene is peaceful, though 
very active.

                         CAMERA STARTS TRUCKING FORWARD, passing 
en route, the different types of individuals 
who frequent the bank. People from all 
walks of life. CAMERA TRAVELS SLOWLY, 
picking up following little scenes.




                         (at window)

                         The check is no good.



                         What?



                         The check is no good. The man has no 
account here.



                         Holy mackerel! I've been robbed.



                         I'm sorry, madam.



                         So am I. And don't call me madam!

                         CAMERA NEXT PICKS UP an elderly lady 
talking to a bank guard.



                         Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money 
here.



                         Is it safe?



                         Absolutely.



                         It's his life insurance money, you know.




                         That's all right. You come with me, 
and I'll show you where to deposit your 
money.

                         CAMERA GOES PAST and now singles out 
three men who are coming forward. One 
glance and we know they are here for 
no kosher reason.



                         They are typical gangster types. One 
of them, the leader, is dressed in everything 
but the kitchen sink. Light fedora, 
stiff shirt and collar with stripes 
running perpendicularly. Flashy gray 
suit - spats - and walking stick. The 
other two are just tough hombres, but 
dressed to kill.

                         As they walk toward camera, they glance 
around the bank with a professional 
casualness, but obviously very much 
impressed. Their eyes rove around the 
place and finally land on some object 
where they stop.





                         As he quickly counts out several thousand 
dollars in bills.





                         Their eyes glisten. Their mouths water, 
as they watch Charlie off scene.





                         Inside the railing. Cluett emerges from 
his office and starts forward, business-like, 
when he suddenly stops in his tracks.




                         He stares off at the racketeers. A look 
of fright comes into his eyes. His impulse 
is to turn back.



                         The three gangsters. A quick flash. 
Their eyes light on Cluett off scene, 
and they glare menacingly at him.




                         There he is! Good morning!



                         He changes his mind about avoiding them. 
His face breaks into a feeble smile 
of affability as he walks toward them. 
CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he approaches 
the three men, his hand outstretched 
in forced amiability.



                         (shaking)

                         Good morning! Who do you want to see?


                         The gangsters shake hands with him, 
their expressions remaining unchanged, 
which adds immeasurably to Cluett's 
discomfort.



                         (flatly)

                         You.



                         (drawling)

                         Yeah. We wanna talk to you about a big 
deal.

                         There is a sinister significance in 
the manner in which he emphasizes "a 
big deal." Cluett is perceptibly ill-at-ease.






                         (uncertainly - sickly smile)

                         Oh, yes. Well, come right this way.


                         He opens the swinging gate in front 
of him, permitting the three racketeers 
to enter. They start for Cluett's office.





                         Helen sits at her typewriter near a 
railing, overlooking the bank below. 
Another girl stands by her, both are 
staring off scene.






                         From Helen's angle.

                         Cluett and the three gangsters going 
into Cluett's office.




                         Helen and other secretary.



                         Hey Pat, come here! Look!



                         (to Helen)

                         That's Dude Finlay, all right - I've 
seen his picture in the papers hundreds 
of times.



                         I wonder what he's doing with Mr. Cluett.




                         (still staring - thrilled - shuddering)


                         Gee, I'm scared. He's one of the toughest 
gangsters in town.






                         Shooting down the length of the table. 
The men are all sitting around the large 
table. Dickson is on his feet.



                         (firmly)

                         Gentlemen, you're only wasting your 
time. There'll be no merger.



                         As Dickson continues.



                         (the injustice kills him)

                         Why should I turn this bank over to 
anybody else? I've worked twenty-five 
years night and day to build it up, 
and now you're asking me to dump it 
into somebody's lap

                         (with finality)

                         Nothing doing!

                         Schultz, who is seated near Dickson, 
looks up at him:



                         You can make a handsome profit on your 
stock.





                         I'm not interested in profits. I'm interested 
in the bank. In the depositors. They're 
my friends. They're looking to me for 
protection, and I'm not walking out 
on them.

                         Clark and O'Brien, also seated around 
close to Dickson.



                         How are you protecting your depositors? 
By making a lot of idiotic loans!




                         (admonishing him)

                         Take it easy, Clark.

                         Ives, seated next to Schultz, becomes 
alarmed.



                         (still trying)

                         My dear friends . . .



                         (unruffled, paying no attention to Ives)


                         It's all right. Let him go ahead. Let 
him speak his piece. I like it. Go on.




                         All right. I'll speak my piece. Dickson, 
you've got to change your policy.




                         As Dickson retorts:



                         What's the matter with my policy? How 
many losses has this bank taken in the 
last twenty-five years?

                         (he looks around - silence)

                         I'll tell you. Not a single one!

                         (defiantly)

                         What's wrong with that kind of banking?




                         (mumbles disdainfully)

                         Just pure luck!



                         Ames, seated beyond Ives, now speaks 
up:



                         Conditions have changed. These are precarious 
times. Banks today have got to be careful. 
And you've been more liberal than ever.


                         Dickson's voice comes in over scene:




                         Yes, and I'm going to continue to be 
liberal . . .



                         As he continues:





                         The trouble with this country today 
is there's too much hoarded cash. Idle 
money is no good to industry. Where 
is all the money today? In the banks, 
vaults, socks, old tin cans, buried 
in the ground! I tell you, we've got 
to get the money in circulation before 
you'll get this country back to prosperity.






                         Who are we going to give it to? Men 
like Jones? Last week you made him an 
extra loan of fifty thousand dollars. 
Do you call that intelligent banking?







                         He can't pay his bills. How do you expect 
him to pay us?



                         That's a fair question, Schultz. Now 
let's see how bad a risk Jones is. What's 
his history? He's been a successful 
business man for thirty-five years. 
Two years ago business started falling 
off. Today Jones needs money, and if 
he doesn't get it, he goes into bankruptcy 
and throws nine hundred men out of work. 
Answer - unemployment.



                         As he listens intently, Dickson's voice 
coming in:



                         It also means his creditors aren't paid. 
They're in trouble. They go to banks 
and are turned down . . . more bankruptcies 
                         . . .



                         As he continues:



                         It's a vicious circle, my friends, and 
the only place to cure it is right here 
at the source. Help Jones and you help 
the whole circle. Now, when Jones comes 
to me, I ask myself two questions. First 
- is he honest? Yes. Second - is he 
as good a business man as he was before? 
And the answer is - he's better .




                         Showing his reaction, as part of Dickson's 
speech comes over scene:



                         He is not only older and wiser, but 
his present trouble has taught him precaution. 
In my estimation, gentlemen, Jones is 
no risk. Neither are the thousands of 
other Joneses throughout the country 
                         . . .





                         To intercut with Dickson's speech.




                         To intercut with Dickson's speech.




                         To intercut with Dickson's speech.




                         The group, as Dickson concludes his 
speech.



                         It's they who built this nation up to 
the richest in the world, and it's up 
to the banks to give them a break. Disraeli 
said security is the prosperity of the 
nation[4]



                         (cutting him off)

                         Why, Disraeli didn't say anything of 
the kind.



                         Well, he should have said it. It's as 
true now as it was then. And let us 
get the right kind of security. Not 
stocks and bonds that zig-zag up and 
down, not collateral on paper, but character!




                         (indignantly)

                         Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?




                         Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's 
idea[5] - the finest banking mind this 
country has ever known. Those are his 
exact words, gentlemen. Character! It's 
the only thing you can bank on, and 
it's the only thing that will pull this 
country out of the doldrums.






                         Cluett sits at his desk, his face drawn, 
panic-stricken. He is like an animal 
at bay. The leader of the trio, Dude 
Finlay, sits in a chair directly in 
front of Cluett. The other two men stand 
on either side of the desk.



                         (menacingly)

                         You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, 
don't you?



                         (trembling)

                         I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have 
been crazy! I lost my head completely!




                         That's your funeral. We've got fifty 
thousand dollars comin' to us.





                         (helplessly)

                         I haven't got it.



                         Shooting past Cluett.



                         (barking)

                         Then what did you want to gamble for? 
If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, 
you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? 
Well, we want our dough.



                         I'm sorry, Dude, butI



                         That don't do us any good.



                         But after all, you can't take blood 
from a stone.



                         (threateningly - quietly)

                         We can take blood from anything 

                         (pauses)

                         If it's comin' to us.



                         Shooting toward Cluett. Dude on opposite 
side of desk, the other two men still 
standing by the desk.

                         A look of alarm spreads over Cluett's 
face. There is nothing hidden in this 
threat.



                         (wants time to think)

                         Perhaps if you'll wait a little while, 
I might be able



                         (snappily)

                         We waited long enough!



                         (shrewdly - to the men)

                         Nix. Lay off.

                         (to Cluett)

                         Now - what's the use of getting excited, 
Cluett? It oughta be easy for you to 
lay your mitts on that kind of dough 
                         . . .



                         Shooting past Dude, as Dude continues, 
slowly, deliberately:



                         There's plenty of it in this bank - 
laying around loose.

                         Cluett looks up - horror-stricken.






                         (pop-eyed, choked voice)

                         Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting 
that I



                         Why not?



                         (perspiring freely)

                         Why, I couldn't do that . . . !



                         (flatly)

                         You don't have to do nothing.

                         Cluett looks up toward the men - then 
at Dude.



                         (slowly)

                         What do you mean?



                         All you gotta do is fix a few things 
for us , and we'll do the rest, see?


                         There is a pause while Cluett stares 
at them, horrified, his confused mind 
trying to assimilate the ghastliness 
of their proposal. Suddenly he starts 
to rise.



                         As Cluett gets to his feet and faces 
Dude across the desk.



                         No, no, I couldn't - I couldn't do anything 
like that. I

                         Smack! The rest of his speech dies in 
his throat. The man to his right has 
slapped him across the face with his 
open palm. Taken unaware, Cluett's hand 
goes to his cheek. He stares at them, 
bewildered and frightened.

                         Cluett, feeling himself trapped and 
helpless, slowly sinks into his chair.







                         Helen sits at her typewriter. A very 
dignified, beautiful woman of thirty 
approaches her. She is Phyllis Dickson, 
Dickson's wife. She radiates refinement 
and culture.



                         (pleasantly)

                         Good morning, Helen.



                         At Helen's desk, as Helen looks up at 
Mrs. Dickson.



                         How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.



                         Is that busy husband of mine busy?






                         (indicating conference room)

                         He's at a board meeting.



                         (not unexpected)

                         Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, 
I suppose.



                         I'm afraid so.



                         Helen, did you ever try competing with 
a bank?



                         No.



                         Well, take my word for it, and don't 
try it. It's useless! If it were some 
other woman, I could handle her, but 
after all, you can't scratch a bank's 
eyes out now, can you?



                         Hardly.



                         Shooting past Helen.



                         Oh, well. I guess the only other thing 
for me to do is to go out and buy myself 
a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes 
out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't 
gotten rid of me!



                         All right.



                         Helen laughs as Mrs. Dickson leaves 
in the direction of Cluett's office.







                         The three racketeers are preparing to 
leave. Dude has his hand on the doorknob.




                         (nervously)

                         Dude - there's not any chance of my 
becoming involved in this, is there?




                         You? No, you'll be all right, so long 
as you establish an alibi for tonight.




                         I know, but



                         Be sure you're with somebody responsible 
in case any questions are asked. Understand?






                         But Dude, listen - couldn't we make 
this some other time?



                         (positively)

                         Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty 
easy. Quit squawking!

                         Cluett looks at Dude, then at the others, 
and realizes he is helpless.

                         He opens the door and the men file out, 
silently. Cluett shuts the door and 
CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses back 
to his desk, shaking perceptibly. He 
reaches into a desk drawer and extracts 
a bottle of liquor.

                         As he takes a drink, Mrs. Dickson enters 
unannounced.





                         As Mrs. Dickson stands watching Cluett.




                         (playful reproach)

                         Oh, oh!

                         Cluett turns quickly. Upon seeing her, 
he makes an attempt to conceal the terror 
he feels.



                         (smiling feebly)

                         Oh, hello, Phyllis.

                         She advances toward him as he rises.




                         (shaking her head)

                         This won't do. Not during business hours 
                         . . .



                         Why, I needed a

                         (offering her drink)

                         Want one?



                         (screwing up her face)

                         Heavens, no! Do you mind putting up 
with me until the financial genius gets 
thru genius-ing?



                         No, no, of course not. Not at all. Oh, 
here.

                         As she takes out a cigarette, he offers 
her a light. Mrs. Dickson notices that 
he is rather nervous.



                         What is the matter with you? You're 
trembling?





                         (trying to be light)

                         Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason 
why I should be, unless of course it's 
you . . .







                         Me?



                         Being alone with you has always done 
this to me. You know that.



                         For a celebrated bounder, that is an 
awful admission. Besides, I never knew 
that any female could do this to you 
                         .



                         Well, you can. You always could.



                         (smiling)

                         Liar! You're just suffering from lack 
of sleep.

                         He takes this as premature defeat, and 
heads back toward his desk.



                         (good-natured admonishment)

                         Here, here, here, now! Don't you go 
back to work on me, too. I'm getting 
tired of this. Besides, it's beginning 
to affect your looks



                         (not understanding)

                         What is?



                         (finishing her little joke)

                         running around. Not your work.

                         (Cluett laughs in relief)

                         You'd better start reforming, Cyril!




                         If I thought you were the slightest 
bit interested, I would.



                         Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know 
something? I've always been curious 
about your line.



                         Line?



                         Whatever it is that makes you such a 
riot with women.

                         He shrugs off the compliment.



                         (continuing)

                         Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it 
out on me. I haven't had any first-class 
blarney thrown at me since the day I 
was married.





                         (trying hard)

                         But you see, it isn't blarney where 
you're concerned.



                         (laughs)

                         Now let me see, what comes next?

                         (a mocking tone)

                         Oh yes, I know - what are you doing 
tonight, Phyllis?



                         He is suddenly reminded of his pact 
with Dude Finlay. Terror returns to 
his face.



                         Tonight?

                         He suddenly gets an idea. He was told 
to be with someone around midnight. 
Someone who would be an alibi for him. 
He stares off at Phyllis Dickson. Why 
not?



                         (continuing)

                         Doesn't that come next?





                         Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing 
tonight, Phyllis?



                         See, we're getting along famously!







                         Clark is in a state of agitation. The 
other directors seem worn by the ordeal. 
Dickson remains adamant.



                         Most of the creditors I know personally. 
I've seen them grow up in the community. 
I knew their fathers and mothers before 
them.



                         I know, Dickson. That's all very well. 
But you're taking too many chances. 
In these times a bank should keep liquid 
in case of trouble. In case of emergency!




                         All the men in the scene.



                         I know what you mean by that. You want 
me to hang on to our cash. Well, I don't 
believe in it. The law demands that 
I carry a certain legal reserve, and 
I'm doing it. The rest of our money 
is out working . . . working to help 
industry . . . to help build up business 
                         . . .





                         As he almost shouts at Dickson.



                         In the meantime, you're jeopardizing 
the safety of the bank. Well, we won't 
stand for it!



                         Of the group, as Dickson turns to Clark.




                         You have to stand for it.

                         Meek little Ives once again tries to 
say something:



                         (exhausted)

                         But my dear friends . . .



                         (interrupting)

                         You're forcing us to take action against 
you, Dickson.

                         Dickson looks at him:



                         Go ahead - take all the action you want!


                         He looks about at the others as he continues:




                         I'm running this bank my way. Get that 
clear!



                         Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses 
to consider our wishes. He refuses an 
offer to merge with the New York Trust 
- the only thing that will put this 
bank on safe ground. He insists upon 
running a bank on so flimsy a thing 
as . . . as faith!



                         Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the 
only thing that means anything to me.




                         As Dickson's voice continues. Clark 
reacts appropriately.



                         Before I take a man into this bank, 
and before I extend credit to anyone, 
I satisfy myself on one thing - do I 
believe in him?



                         On the other men - CAMERA PANNING from 
one to the other as Dickson's voice 
comes over the shot - finally CAMERA 
STOPS on Dickson.



                         So far, my judgement has been right 
one hundred per cent. One hundred per 
cent! When I start going wrong, you 
won't have to take any action. I'll 
turn the bank over to you. Then you 
can



                         merge all you want to. I won't be the 
fellow to run it then. Good day, gentlemen!


                         He exits scene.

                         CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF HIM as Dickson 
passes briskly through his outer office, 
stopping only to speak to Helen at her 
desk:



                         (cheerfully)

                         Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.




                         Yes, sir.








                         (mid-stream)

                         and after dinner, we could go



                         (not at all angry)

                         Oh! Oh, no! I think I've done enough 
experimenting for one day. Congratulations, 
Cyril. You've convinced me that you're 
a philanderer of the very first order. 
I shall recommend you highly.



                         (simply)

                         Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. 
I must see you tonight!



                         Favoring Mrs. Dickson.



                         Tonight, Oh, never! Tonight I have reserved 
for a very special occasion. Believe 
it or not, it's our wedding anniversary. 
Tom doesn't probably even remember it. 
But then, they never do, do they?




                         No, they don't

                         She shakes her head.



                         But I'm giving a party for him - a real, 
old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, 
bells, whistles, and everything. I'm 
really terribly excited about it. I've 
been planning it for months.



                         (after a pause)

                         Well



                         (smiling)

                         Well, what?





                         (he won't give up)

                         Well, aren't you going to invite me?




                         (surprised)

                         You? No can do. It's all set. Just a 
few of Tom's closest friends.



                         Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, 
I'm coming anyway.



                         Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable 
people. They'd probably bore you to 
death.



                         (desperate-sounding)

                         No, they won't. Not when you are there. 
Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.




                         (flattered, but a little suspicious)


                         Why are you so anxious?



                         (intense sincerity)

                         Don't you know?



                         No.



                         I want to be near you!

                         He steps closer to her.



                         What?



                         Don't you know I've been crazy about 
you for years?



                         (still flattered, lightly)

                         Now wait a minute, wait a minute . . 
                         .



                         I've loved you ever since I can remember, 
long before you married Tom Dickson.




                         (still only half-believing)

                         Why, Cyril, you're insane



                         No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided 
you. I was afraid of making a fool of 
myself. But I won't stand it any longer




                         Cyril!



                         Before she realizes what has happened, 
he has swept her into his arms and crushes 
her to him. CAMERA PANS AWAY from them 
to the door to the outer office. The 
door opens and Matt steps in. He stops, 
suddenly, transfixed by what he sees 
off scene.



                         Phyllis Dickson in Cluett's arms (from 
Matt's angle). They suddenly become 
conscious of someone in the room and 
Phyllis struggles free, looking off 
scene toward Matt:





                         From Cluett and Mrs. Dickson's angle.


                         He stares unbelievingly for a moment, 
and then collecting himself, turns and 
leaves the room, closing the door after 
him. CAMERA PANS BACK to Cluett and 
Mrs. Dickson. For a moment she is terribly 
upset.



                         Please forgive me, Phyllis. I lost my 
head for a minute. But I couldn't help 
it, Phyllis.

                         As she starts for the door, CAMERA PANS 
WITH HER. Cluett walks with her.



                         Please stop apologizing so much. You're 
making it far too important.

                         As they reach the door.






                         Matt stands there, in a daze. Cluett's 
secretary is not there. He starts slowly 
forward, hardly knowing where he is 
going - CAMERA TRUCKING AHEAD OF HIM 
- there is a far-away look in his eyes. 
His hand clutches the list of payrolls 
but as far as he is concerned, it is 
entirely forgotten. Several people talk 
to him, but Matt walks on heedlessly. 
He can't get over the shock of what 
he just saw. He always had been under 
the impression that Dickson's home life 
was a happy one. He never dreamed that 
Phyllis Dickson represented anything 
but the height of circumspection. And 
now - Cyril Cluett, of all people!


                         Helen comes running into scene, all 
excited.



                         (happily)

                         Matt, where have you been? Mr. Dickson 
wants to see you right away. Hurry up!


                         He turns around mechanically and continues 
to walk in the direction of Dickson's 
office - CAMERA TRUCKING AFTER HIM. 
Helen falls into step with him.



                         Say, I just heard the merger isn't going 
thru. Isn't that grand?





                         (tonelessly)

                         Yeah, swell.

                         They reach Dickson's outer office. Matt 
crosses it and exits into the private 
office. Helen looks after him - her 
face falls in disappointment. Matt is 
acting very strangely. She thought he'd 
be elated. She stares unhappily at his 
forlorn figure as it disappears thru 
the door.






                         Dickson sits at his desk when Matt enters. 
When he sees Matt, his face breaks into 
a broad, pleasant smile.



                         (grandly)

                         Well, Matt, get ready for the big moment. 
Starting tomorrow you become assistant 
cashier. How's that?

                         Matt crosses to the desk as Dickson 
is speaking.



                         As Matt stops in front of Dickson. Matt 
cannot share Dickson's enthusiasm. The 
scene he just witnessed has taken the 
joy out of everything.



                         It's all right. Thanks.



                         And what's more, keep up the good work 
and who knows - some day you'll be the 
fellow sitting behind that desk . . 
                         .

                         (the idea pleases him)

                         Not a bad thought, eh?

                         He suddenly notices Matt's lack of enthusiasm.




                         Shooting toward Dickson.

                         He leans forward to look at Matt closely:




                         What's the matter? You don't seem very 
excited about it.



                         (feebly)

                         Sure, I think it's swell.



                         (scrutinizing him closely, very much 
hurt)

                         Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. 
What's the matter? Are you sick or something? 
Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.




                         Shooting past Dickson.

                         Matt makes an attempt to snap out of 
it - and answers quickly.





                         Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just 
kind of sudden, that's all.

                         (working up a little enthusiasm)

                         Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. 
Only, well, you've done so much for 
me already . . . I'll never be able 
to thank you enough.





                         Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, 
didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot 
of them didn't think you would. You 
don't know how much satisfaction it's 
been to me. It's been swell. Well, when 
are you and Helen going to get married?




                         Well, I



                         I suppose you want me to fix that up 
for you too, eh?

                         They are interrupted by the sudden appearance 
of Phyllis Dickson. Both men look up 
as she appears in the door.



                         As she stops in doorway. She glances 
fearfully, first at Matt and then at 
her husband, trying to sense whether 
Matt has said anything. She is quickly 
assured by Dickson's affable greeting.




                         As Dickson comes toward her, arms extended:




                         Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.




                         Hello, darling.

                         He kisses her. Then throws his arms 
around her for an exaggerated "teddybear" 
hug. Over Dickson's shoulder, Phyllis 
looks gratefully at Matt.



                         He returns her glance. His eyes are 
unable to disguise his contempt.



                         Dickson and Phyllis. He releases her.




                         If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom 
Dickson! First I trample on the Board 
of Directors, then I promote Matt here 
to assistant cashier, and now to complete 
the day I have a visit from my sweet 
and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a 
man, what a man!



                         (with a half-smile)

                         It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, 
gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.






                         Oooh! That has the earmarks!

                         He notices Matt, still standing there, 
uncomfortably.



                         (good-naturedly)

                         Are you still here? Go on - go to work! 
What do you think I pay you for?

                         Matt exits.






                         As Matt comes out and moves quickly 
forward as if anxious to get away from 
the embarrassing situation he found 
himself in. Helen, upon seeing him, 
jumps up.



                         (excitedly)

                         What happened? What did he say? Did 
you get the job?



                         (dolefully)

                         Yeah.



                         She is perplexed by his unenthusiastic 
attitude.



                         What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought 
you'd be thrilled to death.



                         Come here.

                         (he takes her aside)

                         You know, a few minutes ago I was in 
Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was 
there.



                         Well . . . ?



                         Well, he was making love to her.

                         Helen, although she had a vague suspicion, 
is shocked.



                         (after a pause)

                         Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.



                         I tell you, I saw them!

                         Helen stares at him, horrified.



                         In Cluett's office?



                         Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd 
like to take a crack at that guy.




                         A telephone rings.



                         (as she goes to answer the phone)

                         Wait a minute. Now don't go away . . 
                         .






                         Dickson is seated with Mrs. Dickson 
on the arm of the chair.



                         (talking on the phone, as Mrs Dickson 
waits patiently)

                         Yes George . . . yes, sure . . . Oh, 
that's for tonight, eh? . . . Yes, certainly, 
I'll be there . . . Yes, we'll go down 
together and have dinner in Philadelphia 
. . . Mrs. Dickson gets so upset . . 
. That's right. . . . Yeah. . . . Just 
as soon as the bank closes. . . . Right. 
. . . Goodbye. . . .

                         He punches the intercom, speaks to Helen 
in the outer office.



                         Yes?



                         Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just 
as soon as the bank closes. Make all 
the arrangements, will you?



                         Yes, sir.

                         Mrs. Dickson looks visibly upset. Dickson 
can't help but notice.



                         What's the matter dear? What have I 
done now?



                         Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going 
out with me tonight.



                         Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, 
didn't I?



                         Yes.



                         I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all 
about you. I'm so sorry, dear.



                         Favoring Phyllis Dickson.



                         Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia 
tonight. That's all there is to it.




                         But I have to go, dear. It's a very 
important banker's meeting.





                         (interrupting)

                         I don't care whether it's important 
or not. You said you were going out 
with me, and if you hadn't promised 
so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone 
and planned the whole thing.



                         Listen, it isn't so terribly important. 
We can go to the theatre any time.




                         The theatre?





                         That's what it was you planned, wasn't 
it?



                         (after a slight hesitation)

                         Yes, of course.



                         You can take some of the girls. You 
can take Mildred - or Gwynn



                         The girls! I don't suppose it ever occurred 
to you that I might go out and find 
myself an attractive young man . . .




                         Shooting toward Dickson, as he laughs 
boisterously.



                         Ho! Ho! Ho!



                         Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh 
if I were you. You may not suspect it, 
but I'm still attractive - to some.




                         Listen, don't go around being attractive 
to anyone but me . . .



                         Well . . .



                         Don't you forget that I'm still the 
head man around here too. Now we'll 
get the tickets changed for tomorrow 
night. You and I are going out together. 
How's that?



                         Tomorrow night?

                         A buzzer sounds, and a visitor is announced 
on the intercom.



                         Yes?





                         Mr. Gardner's here.



                         (answering the intercom)

                         Oh, yes. That's that lawyer. All right, 
let him have nine thousand.

                         (returning attention to his wife)

                         Yes sir, I'll step you around this town 
like you've never stepped before. We 
will have dinner at the St. Regis - 
then we'll go to a nice, snappy show 
- then a nightclub - we'll listen to 
soft music, and who knows? Ha! - I might 
break down and dance with you!



                         (still skeptical)

                         All right. I'll postpone the whole thing 
until tomorrow night.



                         (assuringly)

                         Happy now?



                         (mock-pouting)

                         No.



                         He takes her in his arms and kisses 
her.



                         (tenderly)

                         Poor kid, you know, I have been neglecting 
you.



                         Oh, I don't care, darling. I love you, 
anyway.

                         A buzzer sounds again, and Dickson answers 
the intercom.



                         Yes?



                         Mr. Sampson . . .



                         All right. Send him in.

                         There is a knock on the door. Dickson 
moves away from his wife. He looks toward 
the door.



                         Sampson, an executive in the bank, enters. 
Sampson goes to Dickson with some papers 
in his hand. He lays the papers on the 
desk before Dickson.



                         Well, Sampson, what is it?



                         Here's the data on the Clyde deal.






                         Dickson is all absorbed.



                         Good. I'll take this along with me. 
Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm 
sick and tired of the delay.



                         I'm afraid he's been stalling.



                         That's just exactly what he has been 
doing. This deal should have been closed 
weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow 
open . . .



                         He says he can't get away in the daytime.




                         How about his nights? He's too busy 
running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow 
night open, come in and sign this thing, 
or I'll call this whole deal off.




                         Yes, sir.



                         She stands by a window, listening. There 
is despair in her look as she hears 
him making arrangements for tomorrow 
night. Dickson's voice comes over this 
shot:



                         I'm sick and tired of these people dilly-dallying. 
People who can't make up their minds 
                         . . .

                         Mrs. Dickson's eyes close hopelessly, 
and she feels defeated. Again shut out 
from his scheme of things, she realizes 
he is incurable. On this picture of 
resignation:





                         INSERT: CLOCK OVER THE VAULT, reading 
                         5:07

                         CAMERA PANS DOWN to open vault.



                         Inside, several of the tellers are putting 
their cash away. One of them is just 
entering with his truck.



                         Everybody in?



                         I guess so.



                         Where's Charlie?





                         (amused)

                         Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. 
He's out fourteen cents, and he can't 
find it.



                         Good night. Good night, Matt.






                         Cyril Cluett is standing at the bottom 
of a spiral staircase from which he 
has just descended. He stops a second 
and watches Matt, off scene. Cluett 
has gloves on, his hat in his hand, 
preparatory to going home. Matt does 
not see Charlie.






                         Matt and Helen standing near the vault 
door.



                         What's keeping you?



                         Oh, Charlie again.



                         Say Matt, you haven't done anything 
about what you saw today, have you?




                         (still upset)

                         Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like 
to take a crack at that stiff-necked, 
horse dollar.[6]



                         Oh now, don't be silly.



                         (disgusted)

                         Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing 
her.



                         Now you've got me worried, dear.

                         (she kisses him)

                         Promise me you won't butt in.



                         Okay, honey - but just the same I'd 
like to take a crack at that

                         She puts her hand over her mouth:



                         Shh . . . !

                         (whispering)

                         I'll wait for you upstairs.



                         All right, dear.

                         She leaves. Matt remains standing, a 
far-away look in his eyes. It is obvious 
he is thinking about the thing seriously.






                         The boys who were inside the vault now 
file out, having properly locked away 
their cash. At the same time, Charlie 
wheels in his truck.



                         (kidding him)

                         Where you been?



                         (annoyed)

                         Where do you think I've been?

                         (pointing to truck)

                         I took the baby for a stroll in the 
park.

                         The men hurry out of sight, laughing. 
Charlie disappears into the vault. Matt 
enters the vault, his mind still preoccupied.




                         As Matt goes directly to the burglar 
alarm.



                         As Matt's hand comes into scene and 
throws the switch down toward sign reading 
                         ON.



                         Matt starts to the vault door:



                         What's the matter, Charlie?



                         I'm fourteen cents out, and it took 
me half an hour to find the mistake. 
And me with a date, too.



                         I remember once when your account checked.




                         Yeah.

                         Matt goes to the time clock to check 
it up. He tinkers with it a moment.







                         Matt has just finished adjusting the 
time clock as Charlie comes out of the 
vault.



                         (pointing to time clock)

                         And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend 
time clock for exactly nine o'clock, 
so no squawks out of you guys in the 
morning.



                         (as he exits)

                         Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles 
of my own.

                         Matt smiles. He starts to shut the vault. 
He has it swinging half-way around when 
Cluett enters. When Matt sees Cluett, 
the smile dies on his lips.





                         Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?




                         Yes, sir.



                         (peremptorily)

                         Let me see your cash book, will you?




                         Now?



                         Yes, now.

                         Matt looks at him a moment antagonistically. 
He has half a mind to talk to him right 
now, but he recalls Helen's admonitions 
and thinks better of it.



                         All right, sir.

                         He exits into vault. The moment he is 
gone, Cluett crosses quickly to the 
time clock.



                         As Cluett's gloved hand comes in and 
turns the indicator back to 12 o'clock.





                         Matt has opened a compartment and has 
brought out several sheets of paper. 
He goes thru them to find the one he 
wants.



                         Cluett's hand is seen throwing the switch 
up to indicator reading OFF.



                         As Matt comes up to Cluett with a cash 
report. Cluett glances over it.



                         (returning sheet)

                         That's all right. But it seems to me 
you're carrying too much cash.

                         He exits. Matt glares belligerently 
at him.

                         CAMERA PANS with him as he returns the 
paper to compartment. He locks the compartment 
door, switches off the light in vault 
and CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he starts 
out of the vault. As he swings the large 
vault door closed,








                         As a cab drives up to curb in the middle 
of a downpour, and stops.




                         They are in evening clothes, apparently 
they had some drinks, as phyllis is 
in a gay, frivolous mood.





                         (to driver)

                         Driver?



                         Yes.



                         Have you the correct time?







                         12:05. Fine.



                         (looking out)

                         What's this?



                         My apartment.



                         (mock-melodramatic)

                         I knew I couldn't trust you. You told 
me you were taking me home.



                         Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll 
have just one drink, then we'll go.




                         (definitely)

                         No. I know the answer to that one.


                         (shaking her head)

                         I think you'd better take me home.




                         What's the matter? Afraid papa will 
spank?





                         No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much 
interested. He's too busy rushing off 
to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old 
speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. 
Too busy closing big, important deals


                         (on second thought)

                         I think I will have a drink.



                         Good for you. Come on.






                         Cluett and Mrs. Dickson emerge from 
the elevator and cross to his apartment, 
CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. Cluett fumbles 
in his pocket for the key.





                         You know, there ought to be a Congressional 
Medal for men like you. America's comfort 
to misunderstood wives. I never thought 
I would find myself in that class.




                         Oh, you're not so badly off. There's 
something much worse than being a misunderstood 
wife.



                         What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]



                         A misunderstood bachelor.

                         Cluett smiles. He has the door open 
by now and stands aside to permit her 
to enter.






                         At door. Phyllis Dickson has just stepped 
in, and Cluett follows. He closes the 
door and locks it.



                         (mock-melodramatic)

                         And now fair woman, I have you in my 
power.



                         (playing along)

                         I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got 
a moustache!



                         I'll grow a moustache by the time you 
get out of here.

                         CAMERA TRUCKS WITH THEM as he chases 
her into the next room. She alights 
on a piano bench, and runs her fingers 
up and down the scales. Suddenly Cluett 
stops. He stares off, a look of amazement 
in his face. Mrs. Dickson turns and 
follows his gaze and she, too, is startled.


                         CAMERA PANS QUICKLY over to the other 
side of the room. Matt sits on the edge 
of a chair waiting for them. He rises, 
looks off toward Cluett and Mrs. Dickson. 
As he starts forward, CAMERA PANS BACK 
to Cluett and Phyllis.



                         Why, Matt!



                         (when he recovers from his surprise)


                         What are you doing here?

                         Matt enters the scene.



                         The butler said I could stay. I told 
him it was important.



                         Oh, yeah?



                         Cluett steps over to a bell cord and 
pulls it.



                         He's not here. He left at nine o'clock. 
He said you gave him the night off.


                         Cluett wheels around, infuriated.



                         What do you want?



                         Favoring Matt.



                         (uncomfortably)

                         Well, I thought I'd like to have a little 
talk with you.



                         (sharply)

                         I'm listening.



                         (hesitatingly)

                         It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't 
know just how to go about it.

                         (a glance toward Mrs. Dickson)

                         You see, I kind of expected to find 
you here alone.

                         As Cluett starts away:



                         Do you mind stepping outside? We could 
talk



                         Cluett crosses to the door, where he 
stands, ready to open it. Mrs. Dickson 
stands by helplessly.



                         (a tone of dismissal)

                         Anything you have to say to me, you 
can say in the morning.



                         Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same 
to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about 
you and Mrs. Dickson.

                         Cluett releases his hold on the doorknob. 
Mrs. Dickson looks at Matt uneasily 
- she is quickly sobering.



                         (aghast)

                         About me and . . .

                         He crosses slowly toward Matt.



                         Why Matt, what are you talking about?








                         (quickly)

                         I know I've got a lot of nerve butting 
in like this, but I just couldn't help 
it. I thought I could stop two people 
from doing something they'd be sorry 
for.



                         (livid)

                         I'm not interested in what you think.




                         You've no right to do this to her, Mr. 
Cluett. Why don't you think it over? 
It's only gonna get you into a lot of 
trouble.



                         I tell you, I'm not interested in your 
opinion.



                         (turns to Phyllis)

                         No? Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. 
Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. 
Nobody knows it better than you. If 
he ever finds out, it'll kill him.




                         But Matt, you're mistaken about the 
whole thing. There isn't anything wrong. 
Mr. Cluett and I simply came here




                         Shooting toward Matt.



                         (to Phyllis)

                         Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.


                         (snappily, to Matt)

                         You'd do well to mind your own business.




                         (wheeling on him)

                         This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been 
like a father to me.

                         (his voice rising)

                         What has he ever done to you to deserve 
a deal like this?



                         (livid)

                         That will be just about enough! Now 
get out of here!



                         I guess I have said enough

                         (bitterly)

                         I'm just wasting my breath talking to 
you.



                         Taking in Mrs. Dickson, who stands slightly 
apart from the two men.





                         You're right for the first time. Now 
get out!

                         Matt ignores Cluett and looks toward 
phyllis Dickson.



                         I'm appealing to you, Mrs. Dickson. 
Think what you're doing to him. You're 
passing up the whitest man on earth


                         (flaring up)

                         for a dirty, no-good.

                         Before he finishes the sentence, Cluett 
punches him. Matt, caught unawares, 
is thrown off balance and sent reeling. 
He drops between two chairs. Now, livid 
with rage, he pulls himself up, murder 
in his eyes. Cluett crosses quickly 
to a desk near the door, opens a drawer 
and extracts a revolver.



                         (frightened - cries out)

                         Cyril!

                         Matt, who was started toward Cluett, 
stops in his tracks upon seeing the 
gun.



                         Shooting toward Cluett.



                         (under his breath)

                         Now get out of here!

                         CAMERA PANS WITH MATT to the door.




                         Wait a minute, Matt!

                         Matt turns as she enters the scene.




                         I'll go with you.



                         But phyllis!

                         Mrs. Dickson steps closer to Matt's 
side. Cluett comes up to them.



                         You needn't go on account of this idiot.


                         Matt has opened the door.



                         (quietly)

                         You better carry that around with you 
all the time - you're going to need 
it.

                         Matt follows Mrs. Dickson out, leaving 
Cluett glaring after them.



                         A series of quick vignettes:

                         Cluett's watch, showing 12:07.



                         A wall clock, showing 12:07.

                         A night watchman, alerted by suspicious 
noise, creeping up to the vault.

                         The night watchman, shot by figures 
in the shadows.

                         A small number of men rush out of the 
vault, clutching money bags and toting 
guns.

                         The night watchman, getting off a shot, 
before he crumples to the floor.








                         The vault door, partly opened. Over 
the shot we hear excited murmurs.



                         until it takes in the full room. A fingerprint 
expert is working on the time clock 
for finger-print impressions. The medical 
examiner bends over the body of the 
watchman, whose face is covered with 
a cloth. A detective in charge of the 
proceedings stands around, looking very 
officious.



                         What do you say, Doc?



                         Oh, I'd say about eight or nine hours.




                         Well, you'd better call the coroner.


                         CAMERA CONTINUES TRUCKING BACK, until 
it passes a group of tellers and clerks 
in a huddle. They listen breathlessly 
as Oscar, the youngest of the tellers, 
relates his story. For the moment he 
is the center of attraction, and he 
revels in it.



                         (breathlessly)

                         I was the first one to see it. I was 
coming down the stairs, and there was 
the dead watchman at my feet. You coulda 
knocked me over with a pin.



                         (murmuring)

                         Gee . . . Can you imagine . . .



                         Do you see that clock? Right there. 
That's where the bullet hit. When I 
saw that, you coulda knocked me over 
with a pin.



                         Was there much blood?



                         Blood!

                         (gesturing toward body)

                         Come on over fellas. I'll show you.


                         The clerks head toward the dead body, 
but are intercepted by the officious 
detective.





                         (officiously)

                         Get back there . I don't want anything 
touched until the Inspector gets here.


                         The clerks, awe-stricken, retreat.




                         (running up)

                         Oscar, what's the matter?



                         I was the first one to see it. I was 
coming down the stairs, and there was 
the watchman lying dead at my feet.




                         No kidding?



                         No kidding. When I saw it, you coulda 
knocked me over with a pin.



                         Where's Matt?



                         Matt?



                         Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking 
up a wise-crack for this one . . .




                         The detectives got Matt up there in 
Sampson's office.



                         He has?



                         Yeah.



                         Say, did Matt do it?



                         Don't look at me. I don't know.



                         Say, he did look kinda funny yesterday, 
didn't you notice it?



                         Yeah, he did. I noticed it too.



                         You coulda knocked me over with a pin!







                         He sits in a chair. The side of his 
face is swollen from Cyril Cluett's 
punch of the night before.





                         (like a tri-hammer)

                         Come on, come on. You might as well 
tell me the truth. What did you do with 
the money?



                         I didn't do it. I told you all I know, 
Inspector.

                         CAMERA TRUCKS BACK revealing the other 
occupants of the room. The Inspector 
leans over Matt, firing questions at 
him. Two detectives are also there, 
one at the door, the other near Matt. 
Helen stands in a corner, pale and fearful, 
looking on.



                         You turned off the burglar alarm, you 
set the time clock, came back at twelve 
and emptied the boxes, didn't you?




                         (rises in indignation)

                         I wasn't anywhere near this place




                         (shoving him back down)

                         Sit down! When the watchman surprised 
you, you shot him - what'd you do with 
the gun?



                         (desperately)

                         I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!




                         You used to carry a gun, didn't you?




                         Sampson enters hesitantly.



                         Pardon me, but I'd like to use my office 
for awhile!



                         (bellowing)

                         You use some other office!

                         Sampson exits scene hurriedly.






                         The doorman, Gardiner, stands at the 
door, blocking a milling crowd, as Dickson, 
who apparently has already heard the 
news, enters.



                         Come on, open up!



                         Good morning, everybody. What's the 
matter here? Open up the door. Come 
on, open this door.



                         Shall we let the people come in?





                         (snappily)

                         Of course, let them in! You're late 
now.

                         CAMERA TRUCKS WITH DICKSON as he proceeds 
toward interior of bank. Helen rushes 
into the scene and up to him. CAMERA 
                         STOPS.



                         Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest 
Matt. They think he did it!



                         Where is he now?



                         In Mr. Sampson's office.



                         Now don't you worry about it.

                         He crosses in that direction, followed 
by Helen.






                         Cluett comes out of his office, looks 
around cautiously and satisfied he is 
unobserved, walks toward front door 
of bank.

                         CAMERA PANS over to a corner of the 
ante room. Detective #3 is watching 
Cluett. As Cluett leaves, the detective 
follows.




                         Matt is still seated, with the detectives 
grilling him.



                         Then you did it and you did it alone


                         Dickson enters.



                         (to Matt)

                         What's the matter? What's going on here?


                         (to the Inspector)

                         This is ridiculous! You can't hold this 
boy on a vague suspicion.





                         I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.



                         Why pick on him ?



                         It's an inside job. That's a cinch. 
Whoever did it had a pretty good picture 
of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in 
charge of the vaults, isn't he?



                         Yes.





                         Over which comes Inspector's voice as 
he continues:



                         The burglar alarm was turned off. The 
time clock was set for 12 o'clock. What 
more do you want?



                         Somebody else could have done it, couldn't 
they?



                         He admits that he set the clock himself.


                         Matt looks up toward inspector.



                         I did. I set it for nine o'clock this 
morning.



                         As the Inspector turns to Matt:



                         Then who changed it?



                         (helplessly)

                         I don't know.



                         Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

                         The Inspector turns back to Dickson.




                         What time did this thing happen?



                         The clock opposite the vault was stopped 
by a bullet at 12:09.



                         All right. If the boy proves an alibi, 
he's all right, isn't he?



                         If he can do it, yes.



                         Why, certainly he can.

                         (to Matt)

                         Matt, now all you've got to do is tell 
them where you were last night, between 
twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything 
will be all right.



                         (averting Dickson's gaze)

                         I already told him I was home.



                         (to Inspector)

                         There you are.





                         That's what he says. I got a man from 
headquarters checking up on it now.




                         (confidently)

                         Good.

                         (to Matt, smiling)

                         You've got nothing to worry about. Soon 
as the report comes in, you'll be released.


                         (to Inspector)

                         And listen, don't talk so loud. Take 
it easy. Coast a little.

                         He exits scene.




                         Showing the normal activity of the bank 
in contrast to the turmoil going on 
inside. Just a few people scattered 
about.

                         CAMERA TRUCKS towards the other end 
of the lobby, establishing the calm 
and peace of the place along the way. 
CAMERA STOPS on a CLOSE SHOT at the 
bank telephone operator at the switchboard. 
Oscar, the young teller, is relating 
his story for the hundredth time.




                         Gee, what do you think? There was that 
watchman, that poor watchman, lying 
on the floor right in front of me. Oh, 
you coulda knocked me over with a pin!




                         (wide-eyed)

                         You don't say! Dead?



                         Dead? He was lifeless! You know, I was 
the first one to see him. I was coming 
down the stairs, and there was the watchman 
lying on the floor, right in front of 
me. Dead! I tell you, you coulda knocked




                         (interrupting)

                         Yeah, I coulda knocked you over with 
a pin.



                         Yeah, you coulda

                         (realizes he is getting the brush-off)


                         Oh - almonds to you! Almonds!

                         Oscar exits scene. The operator turns 
her attention to the switch-board, apparently 
Oscar has interrupted a conversation 
she has been having.



                         Hello, Mame. This is Gert, again

                         (pause)

                         Say, listen - I just heard something 
that'll make your head swim . . . Listen 
to this . . . Yeah, the bank was robbed 
last night. Yeah, over a hundred thousand 
dollars.








                         (into phone)

                         Who did it?



                         I don't know who did it, but the chief 
teller's in an awful jam.



                         Call me up later. I'm going to call 
up Lou now.

                         She pulls the plug, plugs in another 
wire.



                         Hello, Lou. Did you hear what happened 
over at the Union National Bank?

                         (a light flashes)

                         Wait a minute, Lou.

                         (plugs in wire)

                         Hello? Yes, sir. I'm trying to get them.


                         (pulls plug)

                         Yes, Lou, listen. They was robbed over 
two hundred thousand dollars. Can you 
beat that?






                         Two men coming out of the building, 
engrossed in conversation.



                         Stole over a quarter of a million. Can 
you beat that?

                         The other man whistles in surprise.




                         (whistling)

                         Whew! You can't laugh that off.

                         Several people in the crowd, overhearing 
them, turn and stare.






                         Of an old lady, pitiful expression, 
begging alms. Two gentlemen are beside 
her. One of them reaches in his pocket 
for a coin.



                         I thought the Union National was pretty 
solid.

                         At the mention of the Union National, 
the old lady looks up, startled.



                         I did too.



                         Half a million is a lot of money. I 
wouldn't be surprised if they had to 
close their doors.



                         The first man drops a coin in the old 
lady's palm and they leave. The beggar 
woman, oblivious of the coin in her 
hand, stares unbelieving, at the departing 
men. Suddenly her face screws up in 
horror.



                         Oh, good gracious!

                         She dashes out of scene.






                         A colored bootblack is brushing the 
coat of a customer.



                         Sammy, are you sure about that?



                         (emphatically)

                         Yes, suh! That messenga boy just tol' 
me that Mr. Dickson took it all hisself. 
And it was more than a million dollars.




                         More than a million dollars?



                         (breathlessly)

                         Cross my heart. And I sure hopes that 
man gets a long time in jail, too!




                         Never mind my shoes, Sam.

                         He hastily exits scene.






                         Taking in two chairs. The man on the 
right, being shaved, is in conversation 
with the barber.



                         Well, I always said the Union National 
was a phony bank.

                         The second customer sits straight up 
in his chair.



                         Union National?



                         You had money in that bank, too?



                         Yes. Something wrong?



                         (hysterical)

                         Mon dieu, mon dieu! Run, run!

                         Second customer dashes out of scene.








                         Two men are in conversation. Another 
man is alone. One of the two men holding 
the conversation is the man of the bootblack 
episode.



                         (of bootblack episode)

                         I tell you, I got it from the best authority. 
Dickson got away with several million 
dollars.



                         He is just reaching for his glass, and 
starts to lift it to his lips when another 
man's voice comes into scene.



                         Boy, that's the end of the Union National 
Bank. That's the trouble nowadays. You 
don't know who you can trust.



                         You said it.

                         The third man drops the glass and turns 
toward the two, panic-stricken.





                         Say, is there something wrong with the 
Union National Bank?



                         Something wrong? Brother, that ain't 
the half of it!



                         If you've got any money in there, you 
can just kiss it goodbye.



                         (throatily)

                         Naw, you're kidding



                         No, I'm not.



                         Holy smoke!

                         He rushes out of the scene. The other 
two stare after him.



                         (over-his-shoulder, to third man)

                         If you've got any friends, you'd better 
call them up too.



                         That's a good idea. I have friends of 
my own.

                         He dashes out of scene.





                         (turning to bartender, who has been 
eavesdropping with interest)

                         Imagine that!



                         What bank did you say that was?



                         Union National Bank. They're broke. 
Haven't got a dime . . .





                         Quick cuts of excited phone conversations.




                         (into phone)

                         Listen, Jack, go down to the Union National 
and take your money out of there. Don't 
ask me how I know. I told you it's on 
the rocks. If you've got any friends, 
you'd better tell them too.



                         (into phone)

                         Better give all the men in your plant 
a couple of hours off to get their money 
out



                         (into phone)

                         Tell Mrs. Hardy to tell everybody in 
the apartment house



                         (into phone)

                         All right. I'll get it or bust a few 
noses!



                         (into phone)

                         Holy smoke! I'll get right down there 
if I have to fly!



                         (into phone)

                         Run down there and get your money at 
once!



                         (quick cuts - a rising tide - different 
languages)

                         Hello, dear . . . Hurry! . . . Union 
National is sunk! . . . I told you to 
put it in the vault . . . I don't know 
what's wrong with the bank . . . I wouldn't 
trust anybody . . . everybody's taking 
their money out . . . Union National's 
broken . . . Why take any chances? . 
. . Hurry! Call the others! etc.






                         Showing in comparison to previous shot, 
the effect of the rumors. The lobby 
is buzzing with activity. Lines form 
in front of all the windows. Depositors 
crowd around the writing tables. There 
are not



                         enough pens to go around. Frantic hands 
reach over shoulders for withdrawal 
blanks. CAMERA MOVES FORWARD. Over the 
shot is heard the seething blend of 
many voices.

                         CAMERA STOPS ON a Teller and a Man.




                         Closing your account?



                         Yes, sir. I'm closing my account. I 
wouldn't leave a nickel in this bank.


                         CAMERA STOPS ON a 2nd Man talking to 
a Woman.



                         It's getting so a man's money ain't 
safe unless it's in his sock.



                         They're all a bunch of crooks.

                         2nd MAN

                         You said it.

                         CAMERA STOPS ON Jewish Man talking to 
a 4th Man standing next to him.



                         Say, did I know the bank was going to 
go caflooey? What am I - a fortune teller 
or something?

                         CAMERA STOPS on a MED. CLOSE SHOT of 
Molly (the Zasu Pitts type). She is 
reaching over a man's shoulder to capture 
a withdrawal blank.



                         (fluttering)

                         Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Oh, 
my goodness!



                         What's the matter, lady?



                         Oh, mister, I gotta! I gotta!



                         Well, they only sign slips here.



                         Gimme your pen, please!

                         She grabs pen away from him. He turns 
to someone next to him.



                         Will you loan me that pen of yours? 
I'm in an awful hurry.

                         CAMERA MOVES ON to a CLOSE SHOT of a 
teller frantically beckoning Sampson.






                         I need some more money! All of the depositors 
are withdrawing.



                         I know, I know. I'll get you some.


                         He hurriedly exits scene.






                         Inspector is still holding his ground. 
Matt sits dejectedly in the same place 
as before.



                         (to Dickson)

                         All I know is the bank's been robbed 
and a murder's been committed. The way 
I see it, Brown here looks guilty.






                         What are you talking about? He had no 
more to do with it than you did.



                         Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.

                         (emphatically)

                         Why, this kid's got a record.



                         So have you. So have I. So's everybody 
got a record. What difference does that 
make? You can't go around pinning crimes 
on people just because they

                         He is interrupted by the sound of the 
door opening. He looks off toward door.




                         Sampson stands there, looking off toward 
the group.



                         Mr. Dickson! Can I see you for a minute?




                         No, I'm busy. See me later.



                         But this is important, Mr. Dickson. 
Looks like there's a run on the bank.




                         Dickson and the others. Dickson looks 
off at Sampson, unbelievingly:



                         What? A run on the bank!

                         CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he rushes over 
to the door to Sampson.





                         The lobby's half filled now.



                         What are you talking about?

                         Dickson goes out the door, followed 
by Sampson.




                         As Sampson and Dickson come into the 
scene.



                         (pointing in front of him)

                         Look!

                         Dickson looks in the direction in which 
Sampson points.






                         From Dickson's angle.

                         This shot takes in the length of the 
bank. Clerks, bookkeepers, stenographers 
in the f.g., the lobby in the b.g. It 
seems a little more crowded than in 
previous shot.






                         Sampson and Dickson. Dickson's face 
clouds.



                         They've been coming in steady all morning. 
I have called for some extra police.




                         (his eyes glued on the crowd)

                         All right. Send down to the vaults and 
have our reserve cash sent up here right 
away.



                         We haven't much on hand, you know. If 
it gets any worse, I hope we don't have 
to close the doors.



                         Favoring Dickson.

                         He turns to Sampson.



                         (flaring up)

                         The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth 
a nickel after that. This is just a 
flurry, that's all. They've heard about 
the robbery and got panic-stricken. 
Listen, get ahold of our available securities 
and have them turned into cash. Wait 
a minute. Get my personal stuff and 
have that turned into cash too. Tell 
the boys anyone caught arguing with 
a depositor will be fired on the spot.




                         Yes, sir.





                         As Sampson leaves. Dickson starts out 
in the direction of Sampson's office. 
He is stopped by his name being called:




                         Mr. Dickson!

                         Dickson turns. Clark and several directors 
appear.



                         (grimly)

                         We want to talk to you.



                         What about?



                         We'll discuss that in the board room.


                         He turns to follow, then is stopped 
by another voice.



                         Oh, Mr. Dickson! We got a check on Brown's 
alibi. Do you want to hear it?



                         (only a slight hesitation)

                         All right.

                         (to Clark)

                         I'll be with you in a minute, Clark.







                         Dickson is by Matt's side. The Inspector 
is also in scene. Dickson puts a hand 
on Matt's shoulder.



                         Now don't worry, son. All you got to 
do is answer the questions they ask 
you, that's all.

                         CAMERA PANS TO THE DOOR as it opens 
and a detective enters, beckons to the 
Inspector off scene.



                         As the Inspector crosses to the new 
arrival, who whispers something in his 
ear. The others in the room watch them, 
interested. The Inspector whispers instructions 
to the detective, who leaves. The Inspector 
then crosses slowly to Matt.



                         As the Inspector comes up to the group 
around Matt.



                         (carelessly)

                         So you were home last night?



                         (averting his gaze)

                         Yes.



                         What time did you get in?





                         (haltingly)

                         Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.




                         Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it 
was that?



                         Yes.

                         The Inspector turns away and CAMERA 
PANS WITH the Inspector as he crosses 
quickly to the door and beckons to the 
detective outside.



                         All right, Kelley.

                         Kelley returns to the room accompanied 
by a little old Irish woman. She looks 
around the room nervously. Inspector 
leads her toward Matt.



                         As everyone stares at her curiously.




                         (indicating Matt)

                         Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?




                         Sure I do. He has the best room in me 
house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.




                         He feels himself cornered. The Inspector's 
voice comes over the shot.



                         Did you happen to be awake when he came 
in last night?



                         Yes, sir. I was having me hot mustard 
bath.



                         What time was it?



                         As Mrs. Halligan continues.



                         for the rheumatism, you know.



                         What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?



                         It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters 
was already in. They work at a show, 
you know.

                         The Inspector is getting impatient.




                         What time was it?





                         Huh?



                         What time did Matt Brown get in?



                         Now, let me see - a half hour after 
the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley 
sisters never get home until after




                         (snappily)

                         I don't care about the Dooley sisters 
- what time did he get in?



                         That's just what I'm trying to tell 
you, sir. It was a half hour after the 
Dooley sisters . . .



                         Was it twelve o'clock?



                         Dickson, Matt, and the rest of the group. 
Some show their amusement. Dickson and 
Matt, however, are serious. Mrs. Halligan's 
voice comes into scene.



                         No, it wasn't twelve - 'cause the Dooley 
sisters . . .



                         (interrupting her quickly)

                         Was it one o'clock?



                         Inspector and Mrs. Halligan.



                         Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause . . 
                         .



                         (jumping her)

                         It couldn't have been earlier?



                         No. It wasn't earlier because . . .




                         Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters 
weren't in yet.



                         (firmly)

                         No - because me clock struck four, and 
when it strikes four, it's one.



                         (exasperated)

                         There you are!



                         Matt speaks:





                         Aw, she doesn't know what she's talking 
about.

                         Mrs. Halligan looks at him, offended.




                         Who don't know?

                         She comes toward him threateningly.




                         Listen here, young man - nobody ever 
called me a liar yet and got away with 
it



                         (coming after her, takes her arm)

                         That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.


                         Inspector leads her to the door. On 
the way Mrs. Halligan continues to mumble 
her protest against Matt's insult.




                         For two nickels I'd knock his block 
off. I never told a lie in me life.


                         She exits out of room.



                         As Dickson steps closer to Matt.



                         (heartsick)

                         Is that true, Matt?

                         Inspector comes up to them now.



                         Of course it's true - and he knows it.




                         (tenderly)

                         Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the 
truth, I can't help you. Where were 
you last night?



                         (after a pause)

                         Aw, she was right. I didn't get in till 
after one o'clock.

                         Dickson is deeply disappointed.



                         (quickly - appealingly)

                         But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest 
I wasn't . . .

                         The Inspector barks at Matt:



                         Then where were you?



                         Favoring Dickson as he leans closer 
to Matt.





                         (to Inspector)

                         Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

                         (to Matt)

                         Matt, do you realize you're up against 
something? You're being charged with 
murder. It's serious, son. Now come 
on, I know you didn't do it.

                         (gestures toward Inspector)

                         But we've got to make them believe it. 
Come on, tell the truth, where were 
you last night?



                         (doggedly)

                         I can't tell you.

                         Matt maintains a determined silence.




                         (getting an idea)

                         Listen, if I get them out of the room, 
will you tell me ?

                         Matt looks at him. Dickson is the only 
person he cannot tell his secret to.




                         No. I won't.



                         You're protecting somebody.



                         No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!



                         Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. 
Now listen, it doesn't make any difference 
who it is. It can't be as important 
as this. Now come on, tell me. Where 
were you last night?

                         (a note of desperation)

                         Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you 
trust me, don't you?

                         No reply from Matt. Dickson is heartsick. 
He turns, helplessly, away from Matt 
and walks out of Sampson's office.







                         Of Gert, the telephone operator.



                         (all excited - into phone)

                         What a day, Mame! Everybody's coming 
in and drawing their money out.

                         (innocently)

                         Gee, Mame - I wonder what started it.





                         Shouting from the offices. The lobby 
is now packed to the doors with frantic 
depositors. The low grumbling of before 
is now replaced by



                         vociferous condemnation of the bank 
and Dickson. Individual protestations 
are heard above the din of the crowd.


                         Dickson enters scene, and CAMERA TRUCKS 
AHEAD OF HIM as he quickly passes several 
tellers, giving them instructions to 
pay the depositors without delay. Sampson 
catches up with him.



                         Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going 
crazy.



                         Did you get the case for the securities?




                         Yes, sir.



                         Mine too?



                         Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs 
out, they'll mob the place.

                         Dickson looks off toward the crowd.




                         The fools! If they only knew it, they're 
making things worse for themselves. 
Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they 
lose their heads.



                         What'll we do?



                         I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and 
tell the boys to stall as much as possible. 
Tell 'em not to pay any attention to 
what I said. Tell 'em to verify every 
signature.

                         He leaves the scene as we






                         Taking in a greater portion of the lobby. 
Dickson comes into the scene in the 
b.g. and stands on the stairs, looking 
down at the crowd. He suddenly holds 
up his hand and shouts:



                         Take your time, folks. Don't get excited. 
Everybody stay in line. You'll all be 
taken care of. Don't worry about anything. 
Plenty of time for everything.

                         He has to raise his voice even louder.




                         Now listen, everybody! Listen to me!


                         Gradually their attention is attracted 
to him. All eyes are turned in his direction.




                         Shooting toward Dickson, past the crowd.




                         Dickson standing on the stairs. The 
people looking up at him.



                         I want you to know that your money is 
safe. This bank is in excellent condition. 
If you've heard any reports to the contrary, 
it's based on malicious rumors.



                         Yeah? Maybe . . .



                         It's a lotta hooey! We want our money!




                         All right. You'll get your money - every 
penny!



                         We want it now! We don't want no speeches!




                         As he addresses the crowd:



                         Listen to me now. It takes time. I've 
got seven paying tellers working just 
as fast as they can. If you'll all calm 
down, I'm making arrangements to keep 
the doors open until four o'clock this 
afternoon and you can be paid today.




                         As they cheer their approval and return 
to their buddies.



                         As Dickson starts back toward the offices, 
Sampson comes to meet him.



                         We can't keep open till four o'clock. 
We haven't cash enough to last an hour.




                         Don't you think I know it?

                         They both start walking toward Dickson's 
office - CAMERA TRUCKING WITH THEM. 
As they pass the conference room, Schultz 
comes out and stops Dickson.



                         We're still waiting for you, Dickson.


                         Dickson looks up, studies Schultz a 
moment, as if trying to make up his 
mind whether to consult the Board of 
Directors or not.






                         The door opens and Dickson enters, followed 
by Schultz. They all look up. Dickson 
goes up to them.



                         Well, gentlemen, we've got about one 
more hour to go. You know what that 
means?





                         Dickson and the Directors.



                         (continuing)

                         We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've 
worked twenty-five years night and day 
to keep this bank alive. You've all 
made money out of it. Are you willing 
to help?



                         (defiantly)

                         What do you mean, help?



                         I know that among you, you have at least 
a million dollars in various banks throughout 
the city. Get that money over here and 
I'll stop this run within five minutes.




                         That sounds very simple, Dickson, but 
why should we jeopardize our personal 
fortunes?



                         I have everything I own in it. It's 
your bank as well as mine, isn't it?




                         Clark and Schultz.



                         (this is just what he's been waiting 
for)

                         Oh, is it? Since when? Judging from 
the way you've ignored us, you wouldn't 
think so.



                         We tried to reason with you, but you 
wouldn't listen to us.



                         Shooting toward Dickson.



                         The depositors you were protecting were 
the first ones to pounce on you. You 
thought they were your friends. Why 
don't you go out there now and try and 
get some help from them?



                         Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason 
with a mob.





                         No. You can't reason with anyone else 
when you're in a jam. We pleaded with 
you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't 
listen to us. You preached to us about 
faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now 
you want our help. You want us to throw 
a lot of cash into a bank that you've




                         wrecked. All right. There's one way 
you can get it. Give us an option on 
your stock and resign as president.






                         (quietly - tense)

                         So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long 
time for this chance, haven't you?


                         (his voice rising)

                         Well, I'm not going to resign now - 
or ever.



                         Taking in the others at the table.




                         You have no choice.



                         I haven't? I'll shut the bank first.




                         (terrified)

                         Say, you can't do that



                         I can't? You just wait and see. If that 
run doesn't stop within the next hour, 
I'll shut the doors. You know what that 
means? The bank examiner will step in 
tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. 
I'll insist upon it. The depositors 
will be paid one hundred cents on the 
dollar. What's left you gentlemen can 
have. But I'll guarantee there won't 
be enough to pay your next month's garage 
bill.

                         With which ultimatum, he crosses to 
the door and exits, CAMERA PANNING WITH 
                         HIM.






                         As Dickson barges out. He stops in front 
of the door, and looks off toward lobby.





                         Pandemonium has broken loose. Men and 
women are hysterical. The police battle 
with recalcitrant depositors in a desperate 
effort to maintain order. Strong men 
push weak ones out of the lines. Wild-eyed 
women jostle and scramble to get near 
the paying tellers. Sex and priority 
rights are totally disregarded. Above 
it all the din is deafening. Men and 
women are clamoring for their life's 
savings, ready to commit murder to retrieve 
their little stakes.






                         His face clouds. As he stands there 
watching the chaos, slowly the deep 
concern vanishes from his face and his 
jaw sets in grim determination. He starts 
toward the stairs.








                         Cyril Cluett enters from outside, looking 
guiltily around. Then he starts forward 
and exits from scene. The moment he 
is gone, Detective #3, who followed 
him out, appears in the doorway and 
crosses in the direction taken by Cluett.







                         Dickson and Sampson.



                         Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!



                         Get all the big bills in the place. 
Take them out and get them changed. 
Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute 
them among the tellers. Tell them to 
take their time. Stall as much as possible. 
Count and recount the money.



                         Yes, sir.



                         I hate to do this, but I've got to have 
time to dig up some help. I think I 
know where I can get some real cash. 
Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick 
this thing yet.

                         He starts out of scene towards his office. 
CAMERA TRUCKS AFTER HIM, as he crosses 
past Helen, talking without breaking 
stride.



                         Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. 
I want some numbers to try to get some 
action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds 
- the Exchange . . . Winslow and old 
man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap 
into it, Helen. Just as quick as you 
can.



                         Yes, sir.






                         Pandemonium, din and increasingly hysterical, 
pushing crowds.






                         The directors apparently are having 
a battle of their own.



                         Look at that mob. They're going crazy.




                         You know, this run isn't doing the reputation 
of this bank any good.



                         My dear friends





                         (interrupting)

                         How much longer is Dickson going to 
hold out?



                         You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll 
shut the doors before he gives up control.




                         All right, let him! I'm sick and tired 
of hearing about him. If he wants to 
run the bank, let him do it. I don't 
want any part of it.



                         My dear friends



                         Oh, shut up!






                         Sampson frantically advising tellers.




                         Stall! Stall!

                         One teller faces an angry depositor.




                         Er, is this your signature?



                         Certainly it's my signature. You've 
seen it often enough.



                         I'm sorry, but I'll have to verify it.







                         Seated at his desk, talking into the 
phone:



                         Hello, Parker. Listen. Listen, I've 
got to have a million dollars in cash, 
and I've got to have it quick.

                         (pause)

                         What?

                         (pause)

                         No, no, no. Tomorrow is no good. I need 
it now.

                         (pause)

                         Of course it's safe. Why, the bank's 
in excellent condition. You know that.







                         The Inspector is making preparations 
to take Matt down to headquarters.






                         You'd better tell Mr. Dickson we're 
taking Matt Brown downtown.



                         (to 2nd Detective)

                         Is the chief's car outside?



                         Yes, sir.



                         Okay. Come on son. Let's go.

                         The detective takes Matt's arm and makes 
him get up from the chair.

                         Helen rushes into the room and into 
Matt's arms.



                         Helen clings to Matt.



                         (sobbing)

                         Oh, Matt . . .



                         (consoling her)

                         Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna 
be all right.

                         The detective touches her shoulder, 
tenderly.



                         Sorry, sister.

                         Helen does not move. She clings to Matt, 
sobbing violently.



                         As Detective #3 enters the room. CAMERA 
PANS WITH HIM as he crosses to the Inspector.




                         What did you find out, Mike?



                         I've been trailing the cashier like 
you told me. You're right about that 
guy, chief. There's something screwy 
somewhere.



                         Never mind all that. What did you find 
out?



                         He left here about an hour ago and went 
down to Dude Finlay's joint.



                         Dude Finlay?



                         Yes, sir.





                         Helen slowly lifts her head from Matt's 
shoulder. Her eyes widen as she hears 
the name of Dude Finlay. Mike's voice 
comes over this shot.



                         He stayed about half an hour, and then 
he came right back here. He's in his 
office now.



                         (slowly dawning realization)

                         That's where I must have seen that guy


                         Helen starts out of scene.



                         As Helen leaves Matt's side and crosses 
to the Inspector and Mike.



                         Did you say Dude Finlay?



                         Yes, why?



                         He was in the bank yesterday.





                         (suddenly alert)

                         He was here?



                         He came to see Mr. Cluett.



                         Are you sure?



                         Yes, sir.



                         As he listens intently to Helen and 
the Inspector.



                         Who was with him?



                         Two other men. They all went into Mr. 
Cluett's private office.



                         (pleased)

                         Now we're beginning to get somewhere.




                         Taking in all the people in the room. 
The Inspector turns to the detective 
and speaks quickly:



                         Kelly! You stay here with Brown.



                         (to Tim)

                         Tim, you and Mike come with me. We're 
going down to Cluett's office.

                         He crosses to the door, followed by 
Tim and Mike.



                         As the Inspector turns back and calls:




                         Oh, Kelly - call me up in Cluett's office 
in about five minutes.



                         What'll I say?



                         I don't care what you say. Sing "Mother 
Machree"[8] if you want to, but call 
me up.

                         Inspector, Tim and Mike go out.






                         On the elderly lady depositor and bank 
guard, among the milling crowd.



                         (above the din)

                         Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. 
Everything will be all right.



                         (to bank guard)

                         But you said it would be safe! It's 
his life insurance money. Oh, please, 
I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you 
don't do something, please!



                         Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything 
will be all right.

                         (leading the old lady - pushing a path 
through the crowd)

                         Open up here, folks. All right, folks, 
please!






                         Seated at his desk, talking into the 
phone:



                         Good heavens, man, you're taking no 
chances. No, I'm perfectly willing to 
sign everything over to you. What more 
do you want? I need action. I've got 
to have it within the next half hour.


                         (pause)

                         Yeah, sure - the board of directors 
turned me down, but you know why.


                         (pause)

                         Listen. Listen, read it. It wouldn't 
be a drop in the bucket to you.



                         (pause)

                         I see. Uh-huh. All right - ask me for 
a favor some time, will you?

                         He slams the phone down angrily.






                         Cluett sits at his desk. The Inspector 
stands in front of him.



                         (very suave)

                         I hope you don't mind me asking you 
a few questions, Mr. Cluett.



                         Of course, yes. Just what would you 
like to know, Inspector?



                         Where were you at twelve o'clock last 
night?



                         (much relieved)

                         That's very simple. I was home.




                         Shooting toward Cluett.



                         That is simple, isn't it? I assume you 
can prove that if necessary.



                         (feeling very sure of himself)

                         Oh yes, of course. There was someone 
with me. A lady.



                         (smiling - affably)

                         Looks like you're going to have no trouble 
at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. 
Cluett?



                         If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather 
not say - that is, unless it becomes 
absolutely essential. You see, she's 
married.



                         (a big understanding grimace)

                         Oh!



                         (smiling)

                         You understand?



                         (assuringly)

                         Why, of course.

                         The telephone rings at this point. Cluett 
turns to answer it.





                         Pardon me.

                         He picks up the receiver. The Inspector 
watches him closely.



                         As Cluett answers the phone.



                         Hello . . . who? Yes, he's here.

                         (to Inspector)

                         It's for you, Inspector.

                         Cluett gets up out of his chair to permit 
Inspector to get to the phone.



                         Thanks.



                         (trying to be light)

                         Somebody must be in good humor. He was 
humming "Mother Machree."



                         (laughing)

                         It's one of the boys from headquarters. 
He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever 
he's got good news. Looks like this 
case'll be settled in no time.



                         His face clouds at this. He listens 
while Inspector's voice comes over scene:




                         Yeah, Kelly? Huh? Dude Finlay! Where 
do you got him?

                         Inspector pauses, waiting for a reply.







                         Detective Kelly, speaking on the phone:




                         (into phone)

                         I ain't got nobody here. I'm with Brown. 
Didn't you tell me to call you up in 
five minutes?



                         Sure.






                         Cluett is terrified. The Inspector's 
voice continues:



                         Take him right down to headquarters.


                         Cluett starts to edge out of scene.






                         The Inspector is still holding receiver 
to his ear. Cluett has edged close to 
the door, his expression one of desperation.


                         The Inspector watches Cluett out of 
the corner of his eye as he continues.




                         (into phone)

                         Yeah. What? . . . You don't mean Cyril 
Cluett, the cashier?

                         (long-drawn-out)

                         Yeah-h-h-h-h.

                         (pause)

                         Well! Did Dude Finlay tell you that?









                         (into phone)

                         What? Dude Finlay? Sure, I got him here! 
You know, for a minute I didn't catch 
on . . .






                         On the Inspector.



                         (into the phone)

                         Yeah. We got him here right now. Yeah, 
yeah. Okay Kelly, good work. Looks like




                         He feels himself trapped. He glances 
around the room quickly to determine 
his chances to escape. He keeps edging 
closer to the door with his back to 
it. His hands sneaks down and grabs 
hold of the doorknob.

                         Suddenly, Cluett snaps open the door 
and like a flash is out of the room.




                         As Cluett's figure disappears. The detectives 
are startled by the sudden move.



                         (hanging up receiver)

                         get him!

                         The detectives dash out, Inspector following.







                         Cluett hurries through.




                         At the door of the men's locker room. 
Cluett comes into scene and enters locker 
room.








                         Inspector and detectives enter. Look 
around quickly.



                         (looking off, and spotting Cluett)


                         There he goes!

                         They rush out of scene, their hands 
on their guns, concealed.






                         Metal lockers line the entire room. 
Cluett comes to door on other side of 
the room. Just as he gets there, he 
hears the detectives entering off scene. 
Quickly he changes his mind and springs 
into a space between a row of lockers 
and the wall, at the same time drawing 
his gun.

                         Inspector and detectives enter. The 
Inspector and one of the detectives 
advance into the room cautiously, holding 
their guns in front of them. Kelley, 
the other detective, shrewdly separates 
from them.



                         He must be here. There's only one door.




                         All right. Find him.

                         Cluett slips into a locker and closes 
the door behind him. They hear the noise 
off scene.



                         What was that noise?



                         Sounded like a locker.



                         A locker, eh? Well, search every one 
of them. He must be in one of 'em.


                         They search the lockers one by one, 
until the Inspector happens upon the 
one with Cluett inside. He leaps out, 
gun drawn.



                         From Inspector's angle.



                         Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. 
Drop that gun.



                         (calming tone)

                         All right, Jack, all right.



                         The detective and Inspector. The detective 
drops his gun, but the Inspector keeps 
his levelled, toward Cluett, off scene:




                         Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only 
going to make it worse for you.





                         Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of 
here, or I'll shoot you!

                         He starts slowly forward.

                         The Inspector ignores the warning. He 
takes a few more steps forward.



                         From Inspector's angle.



                         I warn you, Inspector - I'll shoot!


                         He levels his gun.



                         He lifts his gun and aims for Cluett, 
off scene.



                         He is frightened, but desperate. He 
has his finger on the trigger, ready 
to fire.



                         (nervously)

                         If you take another step, I'll

                         A shot is heard. The gun drops out of 
Cluett's hand. His arm goes limp. His 
face screws up in pain.



                         (rushing forward to grab him - to the 
detectives)

                         Let me see it! Let me see it! It's only 
his finger. Get me a towel.

                         (to Cluett)

                         Now take it easy, buddy. Take it easy. 
All we want to do is talk to you.







                         Shooting over the teller's shoulder.


                         People standing in line, an atmosphere 
of pandemonium and hysteria.




                         Still at phone. His coat is now off 
and flung across the desk. His face 
is worn. Perspiration rolls down his 
face. His appearance indicates he has 
been on the phone a long time.



                         (into phone - defeated)

                         You can't do a thing. You're up to your 
neck. All right.

                         He listens. He is being turned down. 
He hangs up receiver. Over his face 
slowly comes a look of deep perturbation. 
He refers to a small notebook open on 
his desk. His finger runs down the list 
of names as he searches for another 
prospect.

                         CAMERA PANS ACROSS as Inspector and 
other detectives, with Cluett in custody, 
enter Dickson's office, all excited.






                         You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't 
have anything to do with it. Here's 
your man.



                         Why, you must be crazy. I've known this 
man for years.



                         He's just confessed. He's been mixed 
up with the toughest gangsters in town.


                         CAMERA PANS BACK to Dickson, as he stares, 
unbelievingly, at the shrunken figure 
of Cluett, who is trembling with fear.




                         Favoring Cluett and Dickson.



                         Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, 
what got into you?



                         (his voice shaking)

                         I don't know. It's all been like a crazy 
nightmare, Mr. Dickson.



                         What happened? You're not a thief. How'd 
you get mixed up with these kind of 
people?



                         Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. 
Last week I lost over fifty thousand 
dollars!



                         (shocked)

                         Fifty thousand dollars!



                         (hysterically)

                         But I didn't kill that man last night. 
Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!



                         As he continues:



                         (dully)

                         Yesterday they came to collect it. I 
begged them to wait. I wanted time to 
think, but they wouldn't listen to me.


                         (his voice rises)

                         They threatened to kill me if I didn't 
pay it! I was desperate! I didn't know 
what to do!



                         As he reacts to Cluett's confession. 
Cluett's voice continues over this shot.




                         (hoarsely - quickly)

                         Then they suggested that I help them 
rob the bank. All I had to do was turn 
off the alarm and



                         fix the time clock. It all sounded so 
easy. It seemed like a way out.



                         As Cluett continues:



                         (wildly)

                         I didn't know anybody was going to be 
killed!

                         The Inspector addresses Cluett:



                         What were you doing at Finlay's this 
morning?



                         They took my keys yesterday. I went 
there to get them back.



                         (desperately)

                         If you were in a jam, why didn't you 
come to me? I would have helped you 
out. You know that.



                         Favoring Cluett.



                         I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. 
I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered 
around in a daze. All I could think 
of was that they were going to kill 
me . . .

                         (pleading desperately)

                         You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? 
You won't go back on me now, will you? 
I'll die if they send me to prison!




                         (practical)

                         Don't forget there's a dead watchman 
downstairs.



                         (wild-eyed)

                         I didn't kill him! I had nothing to 
do with that, I tell you! I was home 
in my apartment last night - I can prove 
it!





                         (skeptically)

                         Claims he was there with a married woman. 
Doesn't want to mention her name.




                         (desperately - to Dickson)

                         He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But 
it's the truth - honest it is. I was 
in my apartment last night - ask your 
wife - she

                         He stops dead. Suddenly he realizes 
what he is saying.



                         As he reacts electrically to the mention 
of his wife.





                         He slaps a hand over his mouth, as if 
to crush out anything further he might 
say. He stares wide-eyed and frightened 
at Dickson.




                         Dickson glares at Cluett, penetratingly. 
His brain slowly absorbs the revelation 
that Phyllis was in Cluett's apartment 
the night before.



                         (dully)

                         My wife? What's she got to do with you?




                         (out of the side of his mouth - to a 
detective standing next to him)

                         No wonder he didn't want to mention 
her name.

                         Dickson comes over to Cluett, grabs 
him by the arm.



                         What was my wife doing in your apartment 
last night?



                         (hysterically)

                         Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't 
pay any attention to me. I don't know 
what I'm saying.



                         You just mentioned her name. What was 
she doing there? What was she doing 
in your apartment?



                         She just came up for a drink. Just for 
a few minutes.

                         Dickson grabs Cluett and shakes him.




                         (a shriek)

                         You're lying!





                         Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find 
out whether he's telling the truth. 
I'll have a man from headquarters check 
up on it right away.



                         (hard)

                         You don't want to check up on anybody. 
I'll do all the checking up. Wait a 
minute.

                         CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses to 
his desk, and calls Helen on the intercom.




                         Helen!



                         Yes?





                         Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.

                         There is an awkward pause while Dickson 
waits. He is obviously agitated. Then 
the phone rings.



                         (answering it)

                         Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. 
I know it's a silly thing for me to 
ask you, but . . . I want you to tell 
me the truth. Where were you last night?









                         (into phone - disconcerted)

                         Last night? Er - why - uh, last night 
                         . . .








                         (very sombre)

                         Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth 
about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?









                         (into phone)

                         In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you 
see, I . . . I . . .






                         Favoring Dickson, but showing Cluett 
and the others.

                         Dickson slowly puts the phone receiver 
down. His face is ashen. He is shaken 
to the core.



                         (miserably)

                         She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It 
wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. 
I begged her to come up. She didn't




                         (an explosion)

                         Get out, get out!



                         All right. Let's go.

                         The detectives get on either side of 
Cluett and silently they march him out 
of the room. Inspector and others follow, 
leaving Dickson alone. When they have 
gone out:





                         Left alone, he is a tragic figure. An 
incessant parade of disturbing thoughts 
tumble over each other in a hectic march 
across his chaotic mind. He grips his 
throbbing temples in an effort to crush 
out the torturous thought that Phyllis 
was involved in an intrigue with Cyril 
Cluett.






                         Most of the directors seem to be weakening. 
O'Brien is remaining staunch to Dickson. 
Clark alone, holds out.



                         Clark, you're insane to hold out any 
longer. Now let's get some money over 
here and stop this run.



                         If we close our doors, our stock won't 
be worth a nickel.

                         Meek little Ives once more tries to 
speak:



                         My dear friends, I



                         (interrupting)

                         I'll lay you ten to one, Dickson won't 
give in.



                         Featuring Schultz and Clark, standing 
together.



                         Maybe they're right, Clark.



                         (weakening)

                         All right, I'll go and have a talk with 
him.

                         As he starts to walk toward the door:







                         Dickson sits at his desk, his head cupped 
in his hands. Clark enters thru door 
of outer office, quietly. He looks at 
Dickson a moment, then crosses to the 
desk.



                         Oh, Dickson . . .



                         Shooting toward Dickson.

                         Dickson slowly looks up at Clark.



                         (softly)

                         Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about 
the bank.





                         (heartsick)

                         The bank. All right. Do anything you 
want with it.



                         His face lights up. This is a turn he 
never expected. He really came in to 
capitulate.



                         (smoothly)

                         Now you're talking sense.

                         (alert)

                         We'll draw up the option on your stock 
- say, eighty dollars a share. How's 
that?



                         He is not even interested, speaks vaguely:




                         Eighty dollars? That's fine - anything 
you say.

                         He waves Clark away.



                         Good, good. I'll draw it up at once.




                         As Clark starts out of Dickson's office, 
elated, Helen comes in.



                         You want the rest of those numbers, 
Mr. Dickson?



                         (toneless)

                         Numbers? No, never mind.

                         She stares at him, surprised, backs 
out of the room.






                         Immediately following:



                         What's he doing, honey? Is he getting 
any help?



                         Something's happened. He isn't trying 
anymore.



                         They must have turned him down.



                         Yes. He called some of the biggest people 
in town.



                         Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought 
to know that. I'm going in there and 
talk to him.

                         As he enters Dickson's office:







                         CAMERA PANS ACROSS as Matt enters:




                         We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. 
We've got to do something quick or it'll 
be too late.



                         (softly)

                         Why wouldn't you tell me where you were 
last night?



                         (ignoring the question)

                         You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?




                         Were you in Cluett's apartment?



                         (dismissively)

                         Oh, I can explain about that later. 
You're losing your bank - don't you 
realize what that means?



                         (gravely)

                         Was Mrs. Dickson there?



                         Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them 
lick you just because a couple of big 
shots turned you down. You've got more 
friends than anybody in this town. Little 
guys - guys who wouldn't be in business 
if it weren't for you. All you've got 
to do is



                         (undeterred)

                         Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was 
Mrs. Dickson there?



                         (fumbling for words)

                         Well . . . uh . . . I . . .

                         Dickson

                         She was, wasn't she? How long has this 
been going on? Do you know?



                         Aw, I don't know what you're talking 
about. All I know is that you're losing 
your bank and



                         (firmly)

                         All right. That's all.

                         (poignantly)

                         Please, Matt.

                         Head bowed, Matt exits scene.








                         Immediately following:



                         Did you talk to him?



                         (downcast)

                         Yeah.

                         (he has a sudden inspiration)

                         I got an idea. Come on, let's get to 
a telephone.

                         They exit scene hurriedly.






                         All of his beliefs are shaken by this 
seeming betrayal. Dickson takes a framed 
photograph of Phyllis from his desk, 
gingerly sets it face down in the center 
drawer of his desk.

                         Also in the desk drawer is - he cannot 
help but notice - a gun.






                         As he dictates to someone off screen:




                         a thirty-day option on ten thousand 
shares of stock of this company, now 
registered in the name of Thomas A. 
Dickson. Now make that in triplicate 
and get it to me just as fast as you 
can. Hurry!






                         Shooting past cashier in f.g. towards 
line of laborers waiting to be paid.


                         Cashier stands in front of a tall counter 
upon which is a small metal box filled 
with currency. He is speaking into the 
phone by his side as scene opens.


                         He hangs up receiver and turns to the 
men on the other side of the window.




                         (speaking thru small window)

                         Sorry ladies and gentlemen, there's 
no more money. You'll have to go on 
to the next window.

                         He snaps the window shut, slams down 
cover of little metal box.

                         Angry ad-lib from line of laborers waiting 
to be paid.



                         What do you mean there's no more money? 
etc.



                         Panicked shouting and pushing. In the 
center of the crowd, a woman faints.




                         Another cashier, another window, another 
angry line of depositors.



                         That's all there is!

                         More pushing, shouting, angry ad-lib.







                         Phyllis Dickson, serious-faced, comes 
up steps and thru ante room on the way 
to Dickson's private office.

                         She pounds on door of office. There 
is no reply from within. Standing next 
to her is a bank guard, uncertain about 
what to do. Throughout scene, there 
are b.g. sounds of melee in the bank.




                         (to bank guard)

                         Are you sure he's in there?



                         Yes, ma'am. He must be in there. He 
hasn't come out.

                         She pounds on the door again.



                         (shouting)

                         Tom! Tom! Tom!

                         (to guard)

                         I've got to get in there. Can't you 
find me a key?



                         (reaching into Helen's desk)

                         Yes, I think there's one right here 
in the drawer.






                         As Mrs. Dickson rushes in.

                         Dickson is standing by a window.



                         She walks over to him - CAMERA PANNING 
WITH HER - and stands in back of him.




                         (softly - seriously)

                         Tom! Oh Tom, darling - I came to explain 
about last night . . .

                         Dickson remains silent. Mrs. Dickson 
continues:





                         Cyril Cluett doesn't mean anything to 
me, Tom. I went out with him last night 
simply because . . . well, I had begun 
to feel that I didn't have any part 
in your life. That I was an outsider. 
Tom, all we did was to go to the theatre, 
and then we went back to his apartment 
afterward for a drink. That's all it 
was. I didn't do anything wrong, Tom. 
I couldn't do anything wrong. I love 
you too much. You know that.



                         As he stares dully out the window.


                         Mrs. Dickson's voice coming over shot:




                         (breaking down - sobbing)

                         Oh, Tom! Tom!






                         Favoring Matt.

                         They are furiously working two phones, 
going down a list of people who owe 
Dickson and the bank a favor.

                         Although Matt has focus in the scene, 
Helen's voice is always in b.g., as 
she handles calls, making the same pitch.




                         (into phone - rat-a-tat)

                         Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's 
getting worse.



                         (simultaneously)

                         Mr. Williams . . .



                         (continuing)

                         The big guys have got the screws on 
him. You've got to come through for 
him, Mr. Conway. He came through for 
you a hundred times. If his friends 
don't help him, who is going to help 
him?



                         (looking up from her own phone pitch)


                         Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!






                         As a man elbows his way thru the crowd 
to a receiving teller's window. He is 
accompanied by a bank guard, who sweeps 
the disbelieving crowd aside. He speaks 
loudly for everyone's benefit:



                         Any bank that Tom Dickson has anything 
to do with is all right. I'm putting 
my money in here. Why should you be 
afraid? Give him a chance. Tom Dickson 
is all right! He's perfectly square. 
I'm putting my money in this bank! I 
know what I'm doing!

                         He reaches a teller's window, which 
is closed. He pounds on it.





                         Open up! I want to put some money in 
here! I don't want to take any out!


                         A teller's face appears, somewhat astonished.




                         (recovering composure)

                         Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!









                         (into the phone - rat-a-tat)

                         They're starting to come in already. 
Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste 
any time. Get all the money you can 
lay your hands on, and bring it down 
here right away. Step on it.

                         He hangs up, dials another.

                         Helen has dialed another prospect also, 
and hands the phone to Matt.



                         (to Helen)

                         Who's this?

                         (into one phone)

                         Mr. Williams?

                         (into the other phone)

                         Mr. Gunther?

                         (to Helen)

                         I'll talk to both of them at once.


                         (holding both phones up to his mouth)


                         Listen, both you fellows. Dickson's 
in a jam. The run's getting worse. Those 
big guys got the screws on him. Yeah, 
both you fellows got to come thru for 
him. Listen, if his friends don't help 
him, who is going to help him? Now he 
came through for you a hundred times. 
Yeah, listen. They're starting to come 
in already. Yeah, listen. Both of you 
fellas - get all the money you can lay 
your hands on, and bring it down here 
right away. Both of you - step on it! 
All right.






                         As several more people elbow their way 
thru the crowd on their way to teller's 
windows, speaking aloud.



                         (loudly)

                         Get out of my way. I got money I want 
to put into the bank.

                         CAMERA PANS WITH HIM and second man 
until they reach the receiving teller's 
window, where they fall into a line 
already containing ten or twelve people.


                         The second man shoves his way to the 
front, and addresses the teller:





                         I want to make a deposit. Four thousand, 
six hundred dollars. He's the best man 
in the world. I believe in him.






                         Dickson and Phyllis Dickson. She is 
still explaining to him.



                         It doesn't matter what you think about 
me, there's something far more important. 
Those people down there. The bank, Tom. 
You can't give that up.

                         She is interrupted by sound of door 
opening. They look off.



                         As Sampson steps in. He looks off toward 
Dickson.



                         Mr. Dickson! Come here a minute. Look 
at this. Something wonderful has happened. 
People are bringing deposits. You won't 
believe it until you see it. You have 
to come out.



                         Dickson and Mrs. Dickson. He shambles 
over towards the door.




                         As Sampson and Dickson come out from 
private office.



                         (pointing off)

                         Look!

                         Dickson gazes in the direction he points.







                         From Dickson's angle.

                         The line has grown in size. Those trying 
to deposit their money are just as excited 
as those who want to draw it out.




                         (shouting)

                         Tom Dickson is a friend of mine! I'll 
put money in his bank any time!



                         (shouting)

                         Anybody who takes money out of this 
bank is crazy! I'm going to put a lot 
of money in! Here it is!



                         I haven't got much, but here it is!




                         Tom Dickson can have all my money any 
time.








                         On Dickson, looking toward Receiving 
Teller's window. He stares at the miraculous 
spectacle, deeply moved. He can scarcely 
believe his own eyes. A smile grows 
on his face.

                         The sight of his friends coming to his 
rescue has an electrical effect on Dickson. 
It revives his fighting spirit. He sticks 
his jaw out determinedly. Without a 
word he turns and crosses to door of 
conference room.






                         Dickson flings the door open. Clark 
and the other directors are startled 
out of their business. Clark holds the 
necessary transfer papers in his hand.




                         Come out here you pawnbrokers - take 
a look at this!



                         We've been waiting fifteen minutes




                         (waving papers away)

                         You know what you can do with that! 
Come on, take a look at this! You'll 
see a demonstration of faith that's 
worth more than all the collateral in 
the world.

                         While he has been speaking, several 
of the directors have edged over to 
the door. They are perceptibly impressed.




                         He has remained unmoved, staring at 
Dickson, as if trying to determine what 
kind of ruse is this.



                         Come on boys! Come on Clark! It'll do 
your heart good.

                         CAMERA PANS WITH CLARK, as he crosses 
slowly to the door and looks out.




                         Look at that. They're shoving their 
hard-earned money across the counter 
with a ten to one chance against them.




                         As they edge out onto balcony overlooking 
scene.



                         If you fellas want to save this bank, 
get some real money over here right 
away.



                         (decisively)

                         That's enough for me, Dickson. I'm ashamed 
of myself. I'll have a hundred thousand 
dollars over here in five minutes.




                         O'Brien starts away and crosses to a 
phone.

                         Dickson turns to the others.



                         Now you're talking! Ames?



                         I'm sold.

                         He goes off.



                         All right. Schultz?



                         (only a moment's hesitation)

                         This is your bank, Dickson, and I'm 
with you!



                         Ives?



                         At last he can say something.



                         (shaky voice)

                         My dear friends, that's what I've been 
trying to say all afternoon.



                         Go ahead and say it.

                         (turning to Clark)

                         Clark, you can do twice as much as any 
of them. How about you?





                         Oh, I don't agree with you, but if everybody's 
gone crazy, I'll go crazy too!






                         As Clark and the other directors make 
their urgent phone calls.



                         (into phone)

                         This is Ben Schultz talking. Send a 
hundred thousand cash over here to the 
Union National right away.



                         (into phone)

                         Send all your available cash to Union 
National!



                         (into phone)

                         Currency - small denominations



                         (into phone)

                         in tens and twenties





                         (into phone)

                         Say, I want one hundred and fifty thousand 
dollars over here right away.

                         (listens)

                         I am in my right mind. No, no, no. Not 
one hundred and fifty dollars. Say, 
listen you guys, one hundred and fifty 
thousand dollars. Yes!





                         A string of armored cars speed toward 
camera, accompanied by an escort of 
eight motorcycle cops. The procession 
heralds its approach by the piercing 
wail of sirens.



                         Open up!





                         A dozen policemen precede the entrance 
of a parade of uniformed guards, who 
carry in one hand sacks of money, their 
other hands clasped firmly on their 
guns. The crowd in the lobby stands 
aside, awe-stricken.



                         Heads up

                         Make way, there

                         Hey, you, look out!

                         Murmurs of approval are heard from the 
crowd.






                         As the crowd is leaving the bank. Everyone 
is smiling and happy.






                         (to nearby man)

                         That's the trouble with people nowadays. 
They hear a crazy rumor, and right away 
they lose their heads. Not me! You didn't 
see me drawing my money out, did you?






                         As she works the switchboard - the next 
day.



                         Good morning. Union National Bank. Just 
a minute . . .






                         As they gather for their morning ritual, 
waiting for Matt.



                         Nine o'clock and all is lousy.





                         Where's Matt?



                         Ten to one he'll have a crack about 
the run yesterday.



                         It's a cinch bet. I wouldn't take it.




                         If he pulls a gag about the run, we'll 
murder the guy. Murder him!

                         They hear Matt approaching, and gesture 
silence. Matt strides purposefully in. 
He works the mechanism on the vault. 
There is a long silence, during which 
nobody says anything, most surprisingly 
of all, not even Matt. Finally:



                         (after having opened the lock - turning 
to the group of expectant tellers)


                         Well, I suppose you guys had a good 
run for your money yesterday!

                         They tackle him to the ground.






                         As Dickson enters, and playfully pushes 
the hat down over Gardiner, the old 
bank guard's face. The bank guard adjusts 
his hat, annoyed, then sees it is the 
president of the bank.



                         (merrily)

                         Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is 
much better this morning.



                         Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right 
too.

                         Guard puzzles over his non-sequitur 
for a moment, then smiles.

                         CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF DICKSON, as he 
strides through the lobby, passing various 
individuals from opening scenes.

                         He spots the teller with a habit of 
smoking on the job.



                         Carter!

                         The teller, from Dickson's angle, holds 
up his empty hands. No cigarettes. Then, 
he opens his mouth and chews elaborately, 
showing that he has switched to gum.


                         Hellos and Good Mornings greet Dickson 
as he continues on his way. He passes 
the janitor in a new uniform, and stops 
him.



                         Well, well, well - got your uniform, 
eh?



                         Yes, sir.





                         Looks good. How much did it cost?



                         (proudly)

                         I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it 
for me.

                         Dickson opens his jacket, affects an 
unenthusiastic perusal of his own well-worn 
suit of clothing.



                         (cheerfully)

                         Oh-oh. I guess I'll have to see Sampson 
myself.

                         CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM as he approaches 
Helen's desk outside his own private 
office. Helen looks up.



                         Good morning, Helen.



                         Good morning.



                         Say, I know what's the matter with you. 
Matt!

                         Matt, hearing his name, dashes up to 
stand next to Dickson.





                         I want you both to take the day off. 
Go downtown and get a license and get 
married right away!



                         (weakly)

                         But I haven't . . .



                         I don't want to hear any more about 
it. If you don't get married, I'll fire 
both of you.

                         By now they are beaming. Dickson starts 
off, then has a second thought.



                         Helen, while you're downtown, you might 
stop in and make reservations for the 
bridal suite on the Berengaria[9] sailing 
next week.



                         Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson



                         Oh!



                         (cutting him off)

                         Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only 
going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and 
I are going to go on the honeymoon.


                         With just the barest suggestion of a 
wink, he exits.



                         Matt looks at Helen:



                         Come, on slave.

                         They exit arm in arm.
