EXT. CITY STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT

CREDIT SEQUENCE.

As OPENING CREDITS play, we study the city's nighttime
pulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connecting
like blood through the veins of a body --
impressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearing
is soulful trumpet-based MUSIC, mellow and haunting, the
modern classic -- JAZZ sound of a Wynton Marsalis,
putting a voice to our story. As CREDITS END, we...

                                            DISSOLVE TO:


POV - EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

Now the MUSIC is GONE, SOUNDS are MUFFLED and vision
blurred. We get the impression of urgent movement. We
hear BREATHING. There are VOICES, SHOUTS, even SCREAMS,
but MUFFLED, far away. Only the breathing is distinct.
We come to realize it is our breathing, and we are inside
someone, looking out. The man whose POV this is is on
the edge of consciousness and not far from death. He
lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an
accident only minutes after impact.

His VISION goes IN and OUT of clarity. People are
swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of
wrecked vehicles. A SIREN BLOOMS in the distance and
approaches haltingly. The man slips away, comes back
toward consciousness, slips again.

The crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to
a police officer. It is a woman, Officer SHARON POGUE,
LAPD. She kneels at the man's side, taking charge,
speaking, but we hear only SLIVERS of SOUND. He sees her
face clearly now, close above him.

Sharon is   a dedicated professional and more. We see down
into her   to a place of real caring. She stares into our
eyes and   connects. We begin to hear her now -- and there
are more   SIRENS converging in b.g.

                          SHARON
            Can you hear me?
(shouting, off)
This one's conscious!

                          VOICE (O.S.)
            Paramedics on the way!

We are slipping away again. Sharon holds us with her
eyes, and she grips our hand.

                                            (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Wait. Wait. Listen to me.    Can
you feel that?

She holds on tight.     We see that our hand, held in her
own, is bloody.

                           SHARON
             That's my hand. Hold it.    Go on
-- as hard as you can.

We watch our hand gripping hers, and as we hold on, the
sights and sounds around us grow more clear.

                           SHARON
             It's over, and I've got you, and
you're safe. You're safe now.
You got that? Don't let go.
Don't let me go.

But our eyes unlock from Sharon's and DRIFT TO a patch of
night sky. Her voice fades awawy. Our POV begins TO
LIFT, MOVING TOWARD that sky, as the blue-black night
begins to turn white. We GO INTO that white light and...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. LOS ANGELES CITYSCAPE - DAY

We PICK OUT a police car from the traffic and FOLLOW.
The beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with
some very rough edges.


INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

Officer Sharon Pogue is driving the car. It is two years
since we saw her at the accident site. Her partner,
ROBBY LEWIS, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the CAD
monitor which lists all area police calls. She slows
behind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car,
driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the
bench seat. The car's ENGINE is MISSING and smoking.

                           SHARON
             That car is older than they are.

                           ROBBY
             '67 Chevy Impala.

                           SHARON
             That's what I said.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           ROBBY
             Needs a servicing.

                             SHARON
             Don't we all.

Robby nearly spits his coffee, laughing at what Sharon
has said and trying not to choke. Sharon smiles, shaking
her head.

                           SHARON
             Get it together, officer.

As Robby smiles, Sharon looks ahead at the young couple
who each have an arm around the other. She is stroking
his neck. He is making gentle circles in her hair.
Sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal a
depth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes her
thoughts away and hits the HORN, startling Robby and
startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive
on.

                            ROBBY
             Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my
coffee again! You didn't like his
hair, or what?

                        SHARON
          I love Elvis hair. They were
going two damn miles an hour.

But Robby's eyes have caught something on the monitor.

                        ROBBY
          Let's roll to this -- fight in
progress.

As Robby secures that coffee cup, Sharon hits the SIREN
and speeds around the car in front of them.


EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

At the same time, a few blocks away, an OLD, FRAIL MAN is
carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for
him.

Walking behind this man is a younger man named CATCH
LAMBERT, an attractive man with some scarring on his
face. His eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but
there is energy in his step. He is dressed in a relaxed
and stylish manner, not expensive. He begins to pick up
his pace to catch up to the old man.

                                             (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

People glance at Catch, nad he glances back in an open
and unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod,
or -- because these are some of L.A.'s mean streets -- a
threatening or taunting look. These he also meets
openly, without a trace of fear. The man has been
through some kind of fire, and it has left him different
from us. Outside the usual boundaries.

Catch walks beside the Old Man, glancing at him.
Finally, the man glances back, wondering and suspicious,
but Catch has a slight, disarming smile, open and honest.

                           CATCH
             Y'know... since we're both walking
the same way, I could take one of
those bags for you. That way, I
do some upper body work while I'm
walking along. Helps my back.
What d'you say?

The Old Man trudges on, proud and suspicious, too.

                           CATCH
             Right now your mind's making
pictures of me robbing your
groceires, but, y'know, nine times
out of ten, people do the right
thing.

The Old Man glances at him, still not convinced, but he
soon has to stop and rest. Catch stops, too. The old
man looks at him, a bit embarrassed.

                           OLD MAN
             It's the dog food that makes it so
heavy.

Catch nods, puts out his hand. The Old Man hesitates,
then decides and lifts a bag, and Catch takes it.

                           CATCH
             I guess it's worth it... for a
good dog.

Catch isn't kidding. He has that honesty. The Old Man
nods and starts trudging again. As they walk on
together, Catch reaches for that second bag. The man
relents and lets him take it. They continue on, Catch
carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a
bit for his upper body work.



EXT. VIDEO GAME ROOM - DAY

This is the call Sharon and Robby have sped to. It is a
chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight
boys, 16-20. A big KID, 18 or so, is being pulled off
another by Sharon and Robby. The Kid is wild and
resisting and Sharon shows her toughness and
professionalism and some anger, too, as she slams him
into a fence -- and Robby holds him while she cuffs the
young man -- who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.

                        KID
          Look at this bitch.    Whoo!   Benny,
look at this!

Sharon and Robby are both very good at their jobs, taking
this Kid to their car while other cops contain the rest.
A crowd watches -- mostly teens.

                        KID
                 (to Sharon)
You come in with me.    Hey, bitch.

Some of his bystanders friends howl at that.

                        KID
          You're going to arrest me, you
come into the back seat with me.
Come on!

He resists a bit, but they're getting him into the car.

                         KID
          Come on.   We'll have a good time.


INT. POLICE CAR - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)

Sharon's on the radio to dispatch as Robby drives and the
Kid keeps mouthing off.

                        SHARON
                 (to radio)
Three Adam Five -- show us 1019 to
the jail with one male prisoner.

                        KID
          Take off your uniform. Take off
my handcuffs, bitch, and come back
here. I want one touch.

                        ROBBY
          Give it a rest!

Sharon is stone-faced through this.

                                                (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           KID
             If you're going to put me away,
you gotta give me one sweet touch.


INT. JAIL BOOKING AREA - DAY

As Robby and Sharon bring their suspect to the booking
counter, each holding one of his cuffed arms. The Kid is
looking at Sharon's hand on his arm.

                           KID
             That ain't the touch.   That ain't
the touch I want.

They get him to the counter.

                           ROBBY
             As I remove your cuffs, I want you
to put your hands here. Spread
your legs. More.

As they remove the cuffs, the Kid makes a sudden move
toward Sharon, reaching between her legs -- but she was
not only ready for this, but hoping for it -- and the
stoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she
moves quickly and grabs the Kid by the hair, bringing his
face into her upraised knee. He cries out and goes down
on his knees, hurting and bleeding. The jailer rushes
over to help, but Robby grabs the Kid's wrists.

                            ROBBY
             That's it.   Back off, John, we got
it.

Robby glances at Sharon -- a dark glance.


EXT. POLICE JAIL PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER)

as Robby and Sharon walk to their car. They are
interrupted by one of their lieutenants, SANDERMAN,
walking their way and stopping to stare at Sharon. She
meets his look.

                           SANDERMAN
             You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue?

She is straightforward, not rebellious.

                           SHARON
             I just dealt with the situation.
The prisoner...

                                                  (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                            SANDERMAN
             And you don't see a pattern here?
(pause)
I want you to keep yourself way
inside the line instead of walking
on it. All right? Are you taking
notes?

He walks away, and Sharon and Robby walk on to their
car -- she is dark; he is glancing at her.

                           ROBBY
             You broke his nose.

                              SHARON
             He grabbed me.     End of story.

                           ROBBY
             And you were waiting for him. You
were hoping. You were making
long-range plans for his ass while
he was mouthing off in the car --
and you're supposed to be above
that shit.

                           SHARON
             If you think I crossed the line,
put it in the report.

                           ROBBY
             Pogo, stop the shit. What is it?
You pissed off at me, too?

They enter the car, Sharon behind the wheel.

                        SHARON
          Not you, Rob. You're a rare
unthreatened male cop with a good
marriage, and you like to eat
where I eat -- so everything's
code four.

She STARTS the CAR and starts to back out, and he reaches
over and turns OFF the IGNITION. She stares hotly at
him -- but then, slowly, she softens, takes a deep
breath.

                            ROBBY
          Come over    for dinner tonight.
I'll call    Charlene. She'd like to
see you.     It's been awhile. We'll
talk about    it.

                                                (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

She STARTS the CAR again, more calm, starts to drive out
of the lot.

                           SHARON
             Thanks. But  she'll invite
friends, try and fix me up. She's
always trying to fix me up so she
doesn't have to worry about you
and me.

                           ROBBY
             She doesn't worry about that.

                           SHARON
             They all worry about that.

They both smile wryly, driving on.

                           SHARON
             You don't need to fix me, Robby,
or fix me up. I don't want some
guy to heart and soul me and then
walk away 'cause he can't stand
the cop thing -- or worse: he
wants cop stories every night
'cause it turns him on, and he has
no idea who I am inside my head.
Anyway, I'm busy tonight.

                           ROBBY
             Got some action, huh?    Well,
that's promising.

                            SHARON
             Yeah.   Hot and heavy.

                                              IMMEDIATE CUT TO:


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding into
crunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone. We BEGIN
DRIFTING TO the rain-spattered window as night sounds
filter in, HORNS, SOMEONE SHOUTING, a CAR MOVING BY with
THUNDEROUS BASS MUSIC that pulses the very air and
RATTLES the LOOSE GLASS of her window.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

Catch Lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in
the rain. Far away we hear that car with a BASS-BLASTING
RADIO.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

In the glow of a street lamp, Catch sees a bright-colored
object in the gutter. He picks it up out of the gurgling
rain water. It is a small toy, a discarded superhero.
He puts it in his pocket, walks on.

Now the car, the prowling, MUSIC-BLASTING, BASS-
THUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling along
slowly -- beside Catch. He glances over, walking on.
There are four tough-looking MEN in the car, looking for
trouble. The MUSIC is DEAFENING. Catch glances again,
walks on. Their eyes follow him like gun barrels. He
stops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car,
shouting over the music.

                          CATCH
             Hey! You want to turn that volume
down? What's your point?

The men, incredulous, stop the car and snap OFF the MUSIC
in order to make sure they're hearing right. They stare
death at Catch.

                           DRIVER (MAN)
             What did you say?

                           CATCH
             What's the point of blasting your
music through the whole zip code?
Don't you realize there are kids
trying to sleep in these
apartments -- old people, sick
people?

They can hardly believe this.

                           DRIVER
             You better watch your mouth,
asshole.

Catch meets the man's look with his own unflinching,
haunted eyes.

                            CATCH
             Why?   What're you gonna do?   Kill
me?

Catch's look is not a macho challenge. It's something
else -- beyond that, a man somehow without limits. One
of the riders in the backseat taps the Driver's shoulder.

                            MAN #2
             Guy's nuts.   Let's go.

The Driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on the
DEAFENING MUSIC and then slowly rolls on, still glaring
at Catch. Catch stands in the rain, watching them go.



INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT

Catch is arriving home, soaking wet. He lives in a
slightly-seedy three-story. As he walks down the
corridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's
door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock.
He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door.

Someone looks through the peephole and then opens the
door -- a young single mother, friendly but with a little
caution, too. She recognizes Catch. Behind her is a
little boy, (five). The woman's name is CANDACE. Her
son is TOMMY.

                         CANDACE
          Hi.

                         CATCH
          Hi.   Your keys are in the...

He gestures, and she sees the keys and retrieves them,
more friendly now.

                        CANDACE
          Oh, thank you. Thanks a lot.
God. I was trying to carry Tommy
and all these bags. He was so
tired. Of course, as soon as I
put him down he had all this
energy...

While she is talking, Catch is staring deeply at the boy,
who is shy. Catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to,
goes halfway to a smile -- but the sight of the kid stirs
that layer of darkness in Catch. He nods a good-bye to
the mother and is about to go. She thinks about this, as
he is turning, and pushes through her remaining caution
to say...

                        CANDACE
          Y'know, we were just baking
nectarine bars because the peaches
weren't ripe. Ever had a
nectarine bar?

He smiles and seems to want to stay, but he is already
retreating. His contact goes only so far -- and no
further.

                         CATCH
          Sorry.   Gotta be going.

And with one more glance at the boy, he walks to his
apartment, unlocks it and steps in.



INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables,
lamps, nothing on the walls. He walks into a spotless,
never-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a
drawer.

In the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found,
some purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action of
opening the door has started some battery-operated
animals moving around in there. Now from his pocket he
takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in
and closes the drawer.

He walks back into the living room. He sits on the
floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still
soaked from the rain. He stares at his thoughts, looking
a bit numb -- and lost.


EXT./INT. DRY CLEANERS SHOP - DAY

Sharon is just leaving with a clean uniform on a hanger
in a plastic bag. It's a neighborhood place where
alterations are done. As she is leaving, an older woman
is just entering. This is MRS. VANDER, beaming at
Sharon, a real talker.

                         MRS. VANDER
          Sherry!

                        SHARON
          Hi, Mrs. Vander. You're looking
good.

                        MRS. VANDER
          Oh, you just wait. I splurged.

She is pulling a new blue dress out of a shopping bag.

                        MRS. VANDER
          It's for the church and the party.
It's just a little too long.

                         SHARON
          Looks great.

                         MRS. VANDER
          Y'know, I cried over the
invitation -- just imagine me in
church.
(laughs)
It'll be so good to spend time
with you.

                                             (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

Sharon forces a smile -- but is mystified. Mrs. Vander
is walking to the counter and pausing to say...

                           MRS.   VANDER
             You know Dan and I   renewed our
vows last year. I    bet that's
where your mom got   the idea.

                           SHARON
             Their vows?

                           MRS. VANDER
             Your mom and dad -- the
ceremony...

Mrs. Vander realizes what's going on and stammers on,
sympathetic and embarrassed.

                           MRS. VANDER
             Oh, well... y'know, I just got
that invitation a few... just now,
so I'm sure you'll...

                           SHARON
             Oh, yeah. We've had... there's
been some problems with the mail
in our building, so... I'll
probably get it today.

They're both covering like mad, both realizing Sharon's
been left out.

                           SHARON
             So, I guess I'll see you.

                           MRS. VANDER
          Sure, honey.     I'll see you there.

Sharon leaves -- Mrs. Vander staring after her, feeling
bad. As Sharon walks away, we see her forced smile die,
replaced by an old pain and darkness.


EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

Robby and Sharon's unit pulls up at a house remodel with
a sign marked "POGUE CONSTRUCTION." Sharon exits the car
and walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both
carpenter and supervisor on the job. This is her
brother, LARRY POGUE, 29. They are not comfortable with
each other -- an old wound. He gives her a wary nod.
She's trying a little harder, being a bit more friendly.
We can sense the strain.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             I didn't see his truck, so...

                              LARRY
             He's not here.

                              SHARON
             How you doing?

She touches his shoulder as she says this, a friendly
gesture, a reaching out. He doesn't respond, only
shrugs.

                              LARRY
             I'm okay.

                           SHARON
             Kathy and the boy? Bet he's big
now.

                              LARRY
             Growin' fast.

                           SHARON
             Is he looking more like you now --
or did he get lucky?

She has broken through a bit and they both smile a brief,
wry smile.

                            LARRY
             He's got Kathy's looks and brains
and my strong back. You should
feel his grip.
(pause)
You just passing by?

She looks about.

                           SHARON
             Place is coming along nice. The
octagon window. Dad's signature.

But Larry's look stays on her, wondering what's on her
mind.

                           SHARON
             Look, Larry, I shouldn't have to
hear it from Mrs. Vander -- about
what's happening.

He turns back to his work now as they speak,
uncomfortable.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           LARRY
             What's happening?

                           SHARON
                    (hurt)
So you really weren't going to
tell me? Nobody was going to tell
me? Mom and Dad renewing their
vows, the church, the party. Mrs.
Vander is all excited. She bought
a new dress. It's blue.

                           LARRY
             We're workin' on Dad. We think
you should be there. We told him.

                             SHARON
             Mom told him?

                           LARRY
             We mentioned it.

                           SHARON
             He's holding out, hah?

                           LARRY
             You want to come?

                           SHARON
             It's my family. Jesus, Lar. It's
over ten years, and he won't let
go of it.

                           LARRY
             You two were always head to head.

                        SHARON
          For good reason. Remember?

                        LARRY
          Let's just leave it.

She stares, then...

                        SHARON
          You're still scared of him.

Pissed, he throws his hammer down on the plywood, turns
to her.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           LARRY
             I don't think it's a good idea you
coming around here in uniform.
People see it, they think we're in
trouble here.

                           SHARON
             Nice seeing you, too.

She walks away.     He frowns, picks up his hammer, goes
back to work.


ON STREET

As Sharon walks towards the car, she sees a van
approaching and she holds up a hand to Robby and calls
out...

                           SHARON
             Two more minutes.

And she walks toward the oncoming van, which is parking
now.


EXT. VAN - DAY

The van is driven by KATHY, Sharon's brother's wife.
Beside her in a car seat is LARRY, JR., four years old.
Sharon comes to the rolled down window on the driver's
side. She has a warm smile for Kathy and the child.
Kathy smiles, too.

                         KATHY
            Hi! Look -- it's your Auntie
Sharon.

                          SHARON
            Hey, Champ, my God, look how big.

She has a special affection for the boy -- who is
subdued, but he smiles a small one for his aunt. She
takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality.

                          LARRY JR.
            Hi.

                         SHARON
            Ow! You hurt my hand with that
grip. Whew.

                                                (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

She shakes her fingers, and he smiles a bit more. Sharon
reaches in and rubs his head in a mock knuckling move.
He laughs. She smooths his hair, affectionately.

                           KATHY
             We're bringing Larry his lunch.
Hey, it's good to see you. It's
been awhile. What?

Sharon is staring at Kathy's badly bruised ear.

                           KATHY
             Oh, I went boom into a low shelf
-- chasing after him of course.
(nodding to the child)
How're you doing?

Sharon pulls her eyes off the bruise to meet Kathy's look
-- and connect.

                           SHARON
             I'm semi-okay. I heard about
the... ceremony and the party.

                             KATHY
                     (embarrassed)
Oh. I hope you'll be there.
(pause)
Really.

Sharon smiles a bit, appreciating the support.       She pats
Kathy's arm.

                             SHARON
             Take it easy.    You too, Champ.

The boy offers his little hand to shake again.

                            SHARON
             Oh, no. You're not breaking my
fingers again.

They smile and drive on and Sharon walks toward her car
and Robby.


EXT. CITY PARK - DAY (NEXT DAY)

We WATCH moms and kids and a basketball game in the park
and PICK UP Catch walking by. Two pre-teens are playing
bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis
practice) wall, and one of them misses, and Catch makes a
lunge and snags the ball. Instead of throwing it to one
of the boys, he fires it at the wall.

                                                (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

One of the boys catches it, bounces it off the wall
toward Catch. Catch grabs it, and now he's part of this
rapid-fire game -- and he's athletic and funny, too,
playing hard and mugging and making them smile until... a
POLICE CAR comes ROARING down the boulevard, slowing a
bit to CHIRP its SIREN a few times -- clearing traffic.
Catch glances up and sees...


CATCH'S POV

Sharon is in the car beside Robby.


ON CATCH

Stunned by the sight of her -- and he doesn't know why.
He can't move, can't breathe, eyes fixed on her. The
POLICE CAR pulls around a truck and ROARS on -- and
that's when he is struck by a memory, a little like
lightning. It comes as a quick --


FLASHBACK - EXT. FREEWAY - ACCIDENT SITE    - CATCH'S POV

-- The man near death. Sharon is bending close to him,
this all just a sliver of an image, and it jolts him.


BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)

The police car is now converging with other squads just
half a block away. Catch throws the ball back to the
boys and runs toward the police incident. The boys watch
him go, wondering.


EXT. CLOSED STORE - DAY

A police   car is parked askew near this closed store -- as
now Robby   and Sharon's UNIT ROARS to a STOP beside it.
Two cops   are calling and motioning to them, one holds a
shotgun.    This is RAY JULIETTE.

                           RAY
             Break-in alarm. One suspect in --
nobody out. Take the back.

And they are moving.


EXT. BACK OF CLOSED STORE - DAY

Robby and Sharon are hurrying around to the back as we
hear more POLICE UNITS CONVERGING in front.



ANGLE - STREET

As Catch arrives on the scene and sees Sharon and Robby
moving around the building to the back. He is still
amazed at the sight of her. He decides to follow her,
keeping her in sight, driven.


ON SHARON, ROBBY

They are scouting through crates and weeds as a young man
is flushed from cover at the back of the store and runs
from them.

                         ROBBY
          Freeze!

The man runs on, and Sharon chases with Robby close
behind her. Sharon speaks to her shoulder radio mike as
she runs.

                        SHARON
                 (to radio)
Three-A-5, foot pursuit. Suspect
fleeing south on Pico Place, young
man, green jacket. No visible
weapon...
(to Robby)
Robby!

                        ROBBY
          Right behind you!
(to man)
Stop and lie down with your
arms... shit.

The man has jumped a fence.   Sharon follows.

                         ROBBY
          Careful!

                         SHARON
          I see him!

She goes over the fence, then Robby.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

The man runs and Sharon chases. Robby, not far behind
glances off to the side, seeing Catch, still following.

                        ROBBY
          Citizen on your right!   Hey!

                                            (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

But Sharon is now closing on the fleeing man who turns
suddenly, pointing a handgun!

                              ROBBY
             Gun!

And Sharon, wide-eyed, is already pulling her weapon, but
not in time. The man is aiming at her and about to fire
when he is tackled by Catch.

Catch and the man go sprawling, and the gun flies out of
the man's hand, and Sharon is on him in an instant,
pointing her gun at him...

                             SHARON
             Freeze!    Right there!

Catch scrambles to his feet. Robby joins Sharon and puts
his knee in the man's back and cuffs him, then glances at
Catch. So does Sharon. But Catch starts to hurry off.

                              ROBBY
             Hey!     Wait!

Two other cops (Ray Juliette and SANCHEZ) rush toward the
suspect on the ground.

                              RAY
             You got him?

                              ROBBY
             He was armed.

                              RAY
             Jesus.

                           ROBBY
             Citizen took him down.

                              RAY
             No shit!?

Sharon stares across the lot to where Catch has halted.
More cops are converging. Ray Juliette and Sanchez move
toward Catch, while a sergeant and others surround Sharon
and the suspect. In between the crowd of cops, Catch and
Sharon glance at each other, during...


ON CATCH

as the cops reach him.

                                           (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           RAY
             What happened here?

                           CATCH
             I... just saw it and... I saw the
gun, so...


ON SHARON

                           ROBBY
             You all right, Pogo?

She is shaken, speaks softly.

                            SHARON
             I was dead.   Y'know.

She glances toward Catch. (She doesn't recognize him
from the accident.) Their eyes meet briefly, but then
their attention is pulled to the others. Sharon speaks
to her sergeant.

                             SHARON
             He had me.    I was dead.


ON CATCH

He is shaken, too.    Sanchez is taking notes as Ray checks
his I.D.

                           CATCH
             I was just walking by.      I live
near here.

Ray nods, handing the I.D. to Sanchez.

                           SANCHEZ
             Sergeant's going to want to talk
to you, Mr. Lambert. We'll need a
statement.

                           RAY
             Don't worry about it. That's just
procedure. Look -- we appreciate
what you did. No bullshit. Let
us buy you a drink tonight, all
right? You know where the Rib
House is?

Catch glances at Sharon again, and he nods.



EXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (SAME DAY)

Catch, a bit bruised and dirty from his tackle, is
carrying groceries up the walkway steps to a small, well-
kept home. He is taking out a key as he walks to the
covered portico.


INT. MRS. CHU'S HOME - DAY

ELANORA CHU, 60, is an attractive woman with warmth and
intelligence in her eyes. She is in a wheelchair, at a
writing table where she carefully translates an English
text into Chinese characters.

She glances up as Catch opens the front door and heads
for the kitchen, speaking as he goes, not looking at her
or into the living room at all.

                        CATCH
          I got you nectarines because the
peaches are hard as rocks.

                        ELANORA
          Your jacket's all dirty.

She rolls away from the table in her motorized chair --
and as they speak across the house, she performs a
ritual...

                        CATCH (O.S.)
          I tackled a guy.

Elanora is moving about the living room, picking up
framed photographs and turning them face down. We don't
see what -- or who -- is in these photos. She is turning
them all in a routine way, used to this.

                        ELANORA
          Why would you 'tackle' a guy?!

                        CATCH (O.S.)
          Why do you think?


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Catch is at the cupboards, putting away groceries as
Elanora rolls into the kitchen, her CHAIR HUMMING.

                        CATCH
          He had the ball. He was going for
a touchdown.

                        ELANORA
          Can you be serious?

                                             (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
                    (as he works)
What day is today?

                            ELANORA
             Wednesday.

                            CATCH
             No.

They are not smiling at their little jokes, but they have
an ease with each other and the deep love of dear
friends. He doesn't pause in his work, but we can see
some nervousness in him as he says...

                           CATCH
             Met somebody today.

Mrs. Chu is now taking some of the groceries out of the
bags to help.

                           ELANORA
             Oh? That's good. Ahh -- they had
the broccolini today. Thank you.

                            CATCH
             A woman.

Elanora is more interested and curious now, still helping
with the groceries and being casual.

                           ELANORA
             You didn't tackle her, too, did
you?

                            CATCH
             No.

                            ELANORA
             Good, Catch.

                           CATCH
             She's a police officer.

                           ELANORA
                    (stops; worried)
Are you in trouble?

Catch goes on working, a depth in his eyes.

                            CATCH
             No.   No trouble.

                                               (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

Elanora watches him work and gladdens slightly.     We see
her own depth of feeling.

                           ELANORA
             Well... that's a good thing.

He is still working, but his eyes are on his thoughts,
his struggle.

                           CATCH
             I saw her once a long time ago.

Elanora stares a moment.      This has meaning for her.

                            ELANORA
             Where?

He doesn't answer.      He's nervous about this.

                           CATCH
             She looks the same.

Now she watches him as he moves to the refrigerator and
continues his work in silence.


INT. RIB HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

It's a noisy restaurant with a large bar area. We PAN TO
a booth of off-duty cops, out of uniform now, including
Ray, Sanchez, Sharon and a few more male officers.
They're all a bit high. Sharon shows the signs, too.
They are passing around a photo now as one COP looks at
it and says...

                            COP
             Beautiful.

... And Sanchez says proudly.

                            SANCHEZ
             Yeah. My wife's got him in
agility class.

                            RAY
             No shit.

Ray is handed the photo, and we see that they're talking
about Sanchez's dog, the name "REX" printed on the photo.

                                               (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           RAY
             'Rex.' Rex is good. I wonder who
the first person was to name a dog
'Fido,' and what the hell does it
mean?

                           SHARON
             I like how you're always asking
the big questions, Ray.

There is some laughter.     Ray is a smart-ass and a flirt.

                           RAY
             I got a big question for you, Pogo
-- but I can only ask it when
we're alone.

She moves some of the change on the table, sliding it
toward Ray.

                           SHARON
             Here -- use this -- call your wife
and ask her instead.

                           SANCHEZ
             I happen to know Ray's wife is
busy tonight.

They laugh and drink and Ray asks her...

                           RAY
             Why doesn't your partner ever come
out with us?

                           SHARON
             Robby's a family man.

                           RAY
             I'm a family man.

                        SHARON
          Yeah, but his family actually
likes him.

More laughter. Sharon's eyes do a quick roam of the bar.
Ray catches this.

                        RAY
          That Lambert -- I guess he's not
showing either.

She shrugs this off like it's not important and starts to
slide out of the booth.

                                               (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           RAY
             Where are you going?

                            SHARON
             The head.   Do you mind?

                           SANCHEZ
             She's just gonna freshen up her
makeup.

                           RAY
             You're wearing makeup?

She leaves the booth with a wry frown.

                           SHARON
             That reminds me, Ray. You still
have that eye-liner you borrowed
from me?

She grins, leaving the laughter behind her.


ANGLE - DOOR

Catch has entered the bar. He is watching Sharon leave
the booth and walk to the rest rooms. He looks back at
the raucous booth and hesitates. He sits at a small
table near the door.


INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sharon is drying her hands in the bar's bathroom, staring
into the mirror. No smile now. We see into her mind for
a second.


FLASHBACK - MAN

Pointing the gun at her face today.


BACK TO SHARON (PRESENT)

in the mirror and see how shaken she still is.


ON CATCH

A waitress is leaving his table, and he looks back at
Sharon's booth and sees that she still isn't there. He
starts to turn, and then freezes as he hears...

                                                (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                              SHARON (O.S.)
             There you are.

She has stepped out of the bathroom and spotted him.      He
is surprised, face to face now.

                           SHARON
             We thought you wouldn't show.    Why
you sitting here?

He shrugs.

                           CATCH
             I don't talk to a lot of people.
Would you...?

He half rises and gestures to the other chair. She
glances back at her booth, then sits. She's nervous,
too.

                           SHARON
             I didn't have a chance to thank
you. I'm Sharon Pogue.

She puts out her hand. He stares at that hand for just
half a beat before taking it. They shake. The feel of
her hand holding his evokes the memory of the accident,
but he covers this.

                           SHARON
             You look familiar.

                           CATCH
             I guess I live on the beat you
patrol.

Her way to cover nervousness is to be blunt, even tough.

                           SHARON
             Why would you do that -- jump a
man with a gun?

                           CATCH
                    (shrugs)
He was going to shoot you.

                           SHARON
             He could've shot you. You have a
death wish? You a bungee jumper?

                          CATCH
             No. I didn't have time to think
about it.

                                                (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             What d'you think about it now?

                           CATCH
             I figure... it was worth the risk.

                           SHARON
             For someone you don't even know?

                           CATCH
             Yeah -- and for what you do. I
think cops are great. Out there,
trying to keep it safe. You know?
Tough job. Firemen are
everybody's heroes. Kids wave at
firemen. People should wave at
cops. Did you ever think about
how many people are walking around
this town because you saved them?

                           SHARON
             I never thought about it.

                           CATCH
             ... because you helped them or
because you arrested somebody who
would've hurt them or because you
just... did your job?

                           SHARON
             Now I'm walking around this town
because of you. Ever think about
that? Maybe you should be a cop.

                        CATCH
          I don't know... I look pretty dumb
in a hat...

He has made her smile.

                        CATCH
          ... and I don't drive and, like I
said, I don't talk to many people.
Am I talking too much? I am. You
go ahead.

                         SHARON
          Okay. What d'you do? You
employed around here? Oh, God.
Sorry. Every time I try to talk
to somebody, it comes out like an
interrogation.

                                                (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             Where do you want to be ten years
from now?

                             SHARON
             What?

                           CATCH
             Somebody taught that to me. Kind
of a shortcut. You ask somebody,
what are your plans for
tomorrow -- what're your dreams
for ten years from now. It's
supposed to get things started.

                             SHARON
             Does it work?

                           CATCH
             I never tried it.

                             SHARON
             Bullshit.

                           CATCH
             No. Really. I just remembered it
-- God is my witness.

                             SHARON
             Not in here.    It's mostly cops.

Now she has made him smile, the first real smile we've
seen from Catch. It's open and real and she is charmed
by it.

                           SHARON
             You have a nice smile.

She's a bit self-conscious, saying that, and just as she
says it, the waitress arrives with shots and beers for
both of them. Sharon looks up, questioning, and the
waitress nods toward the booth. Catch and Sharon see the
cops, staring, smiling, raising their glasses. There is
a hint of teasing in their grins. And now Sharon is more
self-conscious, and a bit tough again, taking her drink
and turning back to Catch.

                           SHARON
             So... what were we talking about?
Oh, yeah, you were giving me some
line about starting a
conversation.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                             CATCH
             The shortcut.

                             SHARON
             Okay.    I'll play.

They clink glasses and drink.         Then...

                           SHARON
             Tomorrow I've got a night watch
shift. If the weather clears, in
the morning I'll go hiking. If it
rains, I'll go to the gym -- and
the laundromat. Ten years from
now... I want to be living in some
mountainous place.

                              CATCH
             Tibet?

                           SHARON
             Could be Tibet. Could be
Colorado. Your turn.

But now Ray Juliette is approaching the table.

                           RAY
             Hey, Pogo -- don't keep him all to
yourself. Come on over, Lambert,
join the group. We'll buy you
dinner, give you a medal for
saving Pogo's ass.

Sharon drains her shot and stands.

                           SHARON
             Actually, I'm kind of tired, Ray.
I'm taking off.

                              CATCH
             Oh.     I'll... walk you to your car.

Catch stands and turns to Ray.

                           CATCH
             Thanks for the drink.

                           RAY
             Least we could do. We don't like
her very much -- but we don't want
to lose her.

Sharon frowns and waves to the booth of cops.        Ray smiles
and shakes hands with Catch as a good-bye.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             Take care.

And Catch and Sharon leave.


EXT. BAR - NIGHT

As Catch and Sharon exit the building, walk toward her
car.

                           SHARON
             It's not a great neighborhood.
Maybe I should walk you to your
car.

                           CATCH
             I don't have a car.

They walk on, silent a moment.      This doesn't come easy
for her.

                           SHARON
             Want a ride home?

                           CATCH
             Oh, thanks, but... I like to walk.

                           SHARON
             It's starting to rain.   Don't be a
hero.

He hesitates, nervous about it, but then...

                          CATCH
             Yeah. If it's no trouble.
Thanks.

They walk to her car.

                           SHARON
             Okay... ten years from now, what
d'you want to be doing?

They walk side by side a moment.      He shrugs.   Then -- in
his open way...

                          CATCH
          I don't know.    This is pretty
good.

She glances at him, taking this in, then fumbles a bit
with her car keys, and he asks -- nervously again...

                                                (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             Can you drive okay?

She gets a little defensive.

                        SHARON
          I'm not drunk. You think I'm
drunk? I'm not. You'll know I'm
drunk when I'm throwing up, and I
never throw up, so don't worry
about it.

He nods, looks at her dead-on a moment.

                        CATCH
          The only time I worry is when
people tell me not to worry.

                        SHARON
          Get in the car, will you?


INT. CAR - NIGHT

As they get in and she STARTS the ENGINE.

                        CATCH
          I'm on Lundy Street, just off
Pico.

They drive a while. She notices his anxiety.     He grips
the armrest when she speeds up.

                        SHARON
          I'm good at this.

                        CATCH
          Streets are wet.

                        SHARON
          Are you one of those people who
drive ten miles an hour in the
rain? I hate that.

                           CATCH
          I never drive.

She glances at him, and he notices her glance.

                        CATCH
          I'll be alright.

                                              (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

He's forcing himself to relax. He takes a deep breath,
sitting back in his seat. He watches her as she drives.
After a moment...

                           CATCH
             Y'know, I can picture you in
Colorado.

                            SHARON
             Oh yeah?   What am I doing there?

                           CATCH
             Driving around... pissed off.

She smiles in spite of herself, slows down.

                           SHARON
             I'm not pissed off at you.

                           CATCH
             Give me some time.

Now she laughs. She drives, not to his building, but to
her own street. She parks, takes a deep breath. This
sounds a bit hard-bitten because she's using her
toughness to cover.

                            SHARON
             Those guys  in the bar are my
friends --  sort of. We work
together,  we tell jokes and we
bullshit,  but I can't say to
them...

She halts.

                            CATCH
             What?

She says this clipped and fast and even tougher:

                       SHARON
         Every time I close my eyes, I see
that goddamn gun pointing at me
and I don't know why I'm telling
you unless it's because you were
there and because I had three
drinks, but I'm not ready to go
inside and close my eyes and I
don't want to go to your place and
I don't want to keep driving
around, so what the hell do we do?

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             Whew. I feel like we're boxing,
and you've got me on the ropes.
(pause)
We'll do whatever you want.

                            SHARON
             What I want  is to know how you
happened to  be walking by that
parking lot  at that minute. What
if you hadn' t been there?

For a moment, she shows her fear.

                           CATCH
             I guess we were supposed to meet.

They stare a while, then she opens her door.

                           SHARON
             If you want -- you can come in for
a minute.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As they walk in, she moves into the kitchen.

                             SHARON
             Want a drink?

                             CATCH
             No thanks.

She pours one for herself while he looks about. It's a
stiff drink. Now that he's here, her I-don't-want-to-
make-a-fool-of-myself alarm is on. She flops on the
sofa, watches him.

                           SHARON
             Sit down or something.

                           CATCH
             I'm circling awhile.

He's looking around at the clutter of her life -- the
intimate details.

                            SHARON
             You're not supposed to look
around. I didn't have time to
straighten up.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             So... it's more real this way.

                           SHARON
             It's rude.

He turns to her.

                           CATCH
             Now that I'm in here, you seem mad
about it.

                           SHARON
             I'm not mad. You'll know when I'm
mad. I don't usually let somebody
in here, but here you are. That's
all. Let's talk about something
stupid.

                           CATCH
             You first.

She smiles in spite of herself.

                           SHARON
             Okay -- one thing I don't believe
is that 'supposed to' business.
We were 'supposed to' meet. That
sounds a little fringy to me, like
something you might hear on public
access TV. You believe that?

                           CATCH
             Some people say we each give off a
particular odor -- that can only
be detected by one other person's
brain.

                           SHARON
             So, we... smell each other?   Who
says that?

                           CATCH
             I have no idea.
(as they smile)
I'm more in the destiny school,
we-met-in-another-life school. Do
you believe that? Do you think
when we die -- we come back in
another form?

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                             SHARON
             You mean like   a duck? No. I
think dead is   dead. I've been
thinking about   it all day -- and I
don't want to   think about it
anymore.

He looks at her, steps close to her, takes the drink out
of her hand, puts it to his lips and drinks it all down.
He puts the glass on the table.

                           SHARON
             Why'd you do that?

                            CATCH
             See?   Now you're thinking about
me.

She gets a half smile, assessing him. Her look is
direct, and the attraction is there. He feels it, too,
and he deflects it, nodding toward a large photomural of
snowcapped mountains.

                             CATCH
          Let me guess.       Colorado.

                        SHARON
          It's Austria, but I can't picture
myself in Austria. I'm not good
with languages, so I couldn't
qualify for the departments over
there.

She rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun
off her ankle. She takes the cuffs off her belt, the
mace from her jacket, the shield from her shirt pocket,
puts them all in a desk drawer. She takes off her jacket
and throws it over a chair. Disarmed, she turns to him.
Her look is all wanting and pushing away, almost fierce
in her struggle. He sees this.

                           SHARON
             Thanks for... coming up here.

                           CATCH
             Does that mean I'm going?

                             SHARON
                      (flustered)
No.    You don't have to.    I...

                              CATCH
             You okay now?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

Her eyes grow a bit hard, defensive.

                             SHARON
             Oh.    You're here as a medic.

                           CATCH
             Is this the mad part?

She smiles in spite of herself -- again. He has gotten
to her. She wants to fall into this guy, but she's
pumping those brakes. They are standing close together.

                           SHARON
             Maybe going is a good idea.

                           CATCH
             Can I come back some time?

                             SHARON
             Why?

                           CATCH
                    (shrugs)
Must be the smell.

That makes her laugh, and her resistance falls away with
her surprised laughter, and she puts her hands around the
back of his neck. Her touch is electric to him. She is
going in for a kiss, and he is retreating. They stare a
moment -- and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and
lets loose his own longing. It is a hungry and
passionate kiss, and in the very midst of it, he breaks
off and pulls back, his darkness rushing at him. She is
staring, surprised, and he is looking a bit shaken,
getting the words out just above a whisper.

                             CATCH
             I better go.

She doesn't know what to say. The moment hangs. He
leaves. Once he closes the door, the breath escapes her,
and she shakes her head -- feeling like an idiot. She
lost control. With a stranger.

                             SHARON
             Oh, God.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Catch leaving Sharon's building in a turmoil of emotions,
staring hard at his thoughts -- and he steps into the
path of a car. The CAR SCREECHES to a stop, and the
scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps
paralyze Catch, and he sees --



FLASHBACK - SLIVER OF IMAGE

Headlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving.


BACK TO SCENE    (PRESENT)

This sliver of memory jolts HIM -- and then another one
comes.


FLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS

coming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory,
and all of this is exploded --


BACK TO SCENE    (PRESENT)

by the angry DRIVER shouting at him.


                        DRIVER
          What the hell do you think you're
doing?!

Catch is numb -- completely shut down there in the middle
of the street. The Driver exits his car and comes toward
him, raging.

                        DRIVER
          Are you crazy?!

Catch isn't even aware of him. The man gawks at this --
and now Catch walks off. It is raining. The streets are
wet.


ANGLE - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

As Catch continues his walk, he is still a bit shaken --
but when he passes a parked car with the window half
open, rain getting in, he hesitates. He can't just walk
on. He looks about. He tests the lock. He opens the
door, rolls up the window, closes the door, walks on.

But a MAN is just exiting a doorway to the street -- and
calls out...

                           MAN
          Hey!    Hey!   What did you do?

Catch stops and turns in the rain.     The Man hurries
toward him, upset, angry.

                                              (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                              MAN
             That's my car!     What the hell were
you doing?

                             CATCH
             Nothing.    I just...

The Man shoves him.

                             MAN
             I saw you!    What did you take out
of there?!

                            CATCH
             No, I rolled up the window.       It's
rain...

The Man gets in his face, shaky...

                           MAN
             You take my phone?!       Hah?!

He shoves Catch again, and Catch's desperate confusion
explodes in a surprising reaction, grabbing the Man's
jacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly
slap, slap, slapping him, saying...

                              CATCH
             Hey!   Hey!    Wake up!    Wake up!

The Man is now speechless, frozen, terrified, as Catch's
eyes hold him with a fierceness -- and a sadness.

                              CATCH
             I helped you.
(pause)
I helped you.

Catch lets him go, and immediately begins walking away,
hunching into the rain, his expression dark and troubled.
He gets five steps away and turns. The Man steps back --
but Catch only says...

                              CATCH
             I'm sorry.

And he walks on.        The Man watches him go.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - NEXT DAY

Candace, Catch's neighbor, is waiting for the slow,
RATTLING ELEVATOR with her son.

                                                      (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

The elevator door opens -- and there is Catch, seated on
a newly-bought wicker chair in the elevator with a small
table across his lap, other boxes nearby and a
long-stemmed rose in his hand, wrapped for giving.

                             CATCH
             Oh.   Sorry.

He rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the
elevator so the woman and little boy can enter.

                             CANDACE
             Shopping day?

He smiles at her, a bit less subdued than before as he
gets his things into the hall -- and he manages a special
look for Tommy, a wink. He frees the elevator; they step
inside. As the door starts to close, Catch's face
"follows" the sliding door with a funny look for the boy.
We hear Tommy laugh as the door closes. Catch carries
his new possessions to his apartment.


EXT. OLDER HOUSE - LATE DAY

A well-kept older home, well-planted, pretty. A woman of
nearly 60 is tending the flowers. She hears someone
approaching the gate in the wooden fence. She looks up.
Sharon is at the gate, in uniform, on her dinner break.
The older woman is her MOTHER, Elaine Pogue. There is an
old strain between them, a sadness -- and a nervousness
in Elaine. She's a quiet woman. She smiles at her
daughter as Sharon comes through the gate. They hug
tentatively, a lot of baggage here. Sharon turns to the
garden.

                           SHARON
             It's looking great, Mom.

                           MOTHER
                    (pleased)
Thanks, honey. It's the best year
ever for the impatiens. The very
best.

There is a beat of awkward silence.

                             MOTHER
             Let's go in.


INT. POGUE HOME - DAY

As they enter.

                                             (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

It's a bit dark inside, older furniture, lots of keepsake
clutter and photos. Sharon is restless in here -- bad
memories.

                           SHARON
             Looks the same. Still smells like
cigarettes. I thought he quit.

                           MOTHER
             He's down to six a day.

                           SHARON
             Your hair looks nice.

Her Mother touches her hair, self-consciously. She can't
help glancing at her daughter in all that gear --
bullet-proof vest under her shirt, radio, cuffs -- and
that gun.

                              MOTHER
             Are you well?

Sharon steps close to the mantel. There is a photo of
her there, graduating from the police academy, a
professional, not a family shot. She is surprised.

                           SHARON
             I guess I'm well. Is this always
here?

                            MOTHER
             Yes.   It's always there.

                           SHARON
             Did Larry tell you I came by where
he's working? Is that why you
called me?

                           MOTHER
             I called because we want to invite
you to our renewal of vows. It's
three weeks from Saturday.

                              SHARON
             Who's 'we.'     You said 'we' want to
invite you.

                              MOTHER
             The family.

Sharon takes that in, still looking about.

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             How come you're renewing your
vows?

                           MOTHER
             It's sort of... a fresh start.

                            SHARON
             Your idea?

                           MOTHER
             No. Both of us. It's a way of...
having the marriage blessed.

                           SHARON
             Wasn't it blessed before?

Her Mother sighs, sad for all the trouble between them.

                           MOTHER
             Sherry... of course it was
blessed. You just...

                           SHARON
             I just what, Mom?

                           MOTHER
             You just think about the bad, and
you never remember the good. I
wish you remembered the good.

Sharon stares deeply at her.

                           SHARON
             Sorry.  I wish I did, too.
(then, almost
like a child)
Does he? Remember any good about
me?

                           MOTHER
             Of course. He doesn't hate you.
He just... still feels hurt.

                             SHARON
             Hurt?    I hurt him?

                       MOTHER
         Being arrested like that.
Somebody doesn't forget that.

                      SHARON
         Oh? How come you forgot what he
did?

                                                 (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           MOTHER
             It wasn't as bad -- you always
make it sound worse. And it
hasn't been that way for years.

                        SHARON
          I'm glad it hasn't been that way.
That means it worked, Mom. That
was the point. That's why I did
it. Christ. Why do I get
punished for it?

                        MOTHER
          Honey, nobody's punishing you.
We're inviting you. Will you
come?

                        SHARON
          Of course I'll come.

                        MOTHER
          We didn't think you'd want to.

                          SHARON
          Why not?

Now her Mother shows a trace of fear.     She says gently...

                        MOTHER
          We don't want any trouble... on
that day. Please.

                           SHARON
             Mom, I'm your daughter. I don't
want any trouble -- ever. I'll
come to the ceremony. I won't
come to argue, and I won't come in
uniform.

They each get a small, sad smile.

                           MOTHER
             It's on the 23rd. Saint Monica's.

                           SHARON
             I'd like you to send me an
invitation. Mrs. Vander said it's
a beautiful invitation.

Her Mother starts to leave the room.

                              MOTHER
             I'll show you.

                                               (CONTINUED)



CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Mom. I'd like to get one... in
the mail... from my family. Okay?

                           MOTHER
             Yes.

Sharon goes to the door, then stops and turns, letting
her guard down all the way to say...

                           SHARON
             Tell Dad... thanks.

And she leaves.


EXT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Sharon is climbing the   outdoor staircase to her
apartment, tired after   her shift, drained a bit   by her
visit home. When she    reaches her door she sees   that a
long-stemmed rose has   been masking-taped to her   door.
Written on the masking   tape is: "Catch Lambert"    and a
phone number.

She pauses, staring at this, gets a little grin.


INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

Sharon is dressed for bed in a sleep shirt, lying on the
bed, surrounded by old photos and a couple of photo
albums from her girlhood. In a vase on her bed table is
Catch's rose.

Sharon is feeling blue, looking at her young self within
the family that has shut her out. She closes the book,
angry at herself for nearly crying. She sits up and
catches sight of the rose and rummages in the drawer and
pulls out the tape with Catch's phone number on it.

She's very conflicted    about this. She puts the tape
down, but it sticks to    her fingers. She tears it off and
tries to throw it onto    the table, but it hangsoff her
thumb. She sighs and     steels herself and dialsthe
number.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT

He has bought a shelf unit that "needs some assembly" and
he's at work with a screwdriver, his new chair and table
nearby, the phone on the floor. PHONE RINGS, and he
picks it up.



FULL SHOT

As we INTERCUT the call:

                          SHARON
            Do you have a machine?

                           CATCH
            What?

                          SHARON
            Do you have an answering machine?

                           CATCH
            Yes.

                          SHARON
            Will you hang up please, and I'll
call your machine.

                           CATCH
            Why
